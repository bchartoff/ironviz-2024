Valley of Fire was one of three locations used in the film. All that remains of the set is a portion of a rock wall of a hacienda.[ 13 ]\n  * The outside \u3010104\u2020Mars\u3011 scenes from \u3010105\u2020Total Recall\u3011, starring \u3010106\u2020Arnold Schwarzenegger\u3011, were almost totally shot in Valley of Fire.[ 14 ]\n  * The scenes from planet Veridian III from \u3010107\u2020Star Trek Generations\u3011 were filmed here in 1994.[ 15 ] The Silica Dome is particularly highlighted for Star Trek fans as the site of iconic starship captain \u3010108\u2020James T.

Campground Road is a loop that will take you back onto the main Valley of Fire Highway. The road turns into an unpaved, washboard road after Arch Rock. It can get very bumpy. This place is my favorite out of all the other stops. Here, you can explore a super cool wind cave called Fire Cave. It\u2019s not hard to find but kind of confusing because there are many other wind caves around. You can see it right off the road if you know where to look. The Windstone Arch is a small arch off in the distance, to the right of the Fire Cave. There are so many other things to explore here. We ran out of time so we didn\u2019t have a chance to really look around. However, we would love to on our next visit.\n\n\u301054\u2020 \u3011 \u301055\u2020 \u3011 \u301056\u2020 \u3011 \u301057\u2020 \u3011 \u301058\u2020 \u3011 \u301059\u2020 \u3011 \n\n###   \nSeven Sisters \n\nCoordinates: \u301060\u202036\u00b025\u201935.5\u2033N 114\u00b030\u201908.2\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nSeven Sisters are yes, you guess it, seven towering red, eroded boulders surround by the sandy desert. At one time, they were a part of the nearby red formations. Because of the relentless forces of erosion, these rock towers are all that remain. This is a good place to stop for a quick lunch or picnics since there are tables and restrooms here. \n\n[Image 4]Photo Credit: Deanna Swaney\n\n###   \nElephant Rock \n\nCoordinates: \u301061\u202036\u00b025\u201941.3\u2033N 114\u00b027\u201936.7\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nElephant Rock is one of the most popular rock formations at Valley of Fire State Park. It is the closest to the East Entrance to the park. If you pay attention, you can see Elephant Rock on the side of the road. The coordinates above show where the actual rock is. Parking for this spot is just right before it. Please, do not park on the shoulders. There are trails to take you to the front and behind the formation. The view is definitely better from the back. \n\n\u301062\u2020 \u3011 \u301063\u2020 \u3011 \u301064\u2020 \u3011 \n\n###   \nMouse\u2019s Tank Scenic Road \n\nCoordinates: \u301065\u202036\u00b025\u201943.0\u2033N 114\u00b030\u201950.2\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nIf you\u2019re visiting Valley of Fire State Park, you have to drive through Mouse\u2019s Tank Scenic Road. Not only this scenic road will take you to most of the epic hikes in the park such as the \u301066\u2020Fire Wave\u3011 or \u301067\u2020Pastel/Pink Canyon\u3011, but it\u2019s also a breathtaking drive. Mouse\u2019s Tank snakes through bright red narrow canyons, stunning viewpoints, and colorful rocks. It starts at the Visitor Center and ends at White Domes trailhead. This road is only 5.7 miles long. \n\n\u301068\u2020 \u3011 \u301069\u2020 \u3011 \u301070\u2020 \u3011 \u301071\u2020 \u3011 \n\n###   \nRainbow Vista Viewpoint \n\nCoordinates: \u301072\u202036\u00b027\u201901.3\u2033N 114\u00b030\u201955.1\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nThe view of Mouse\u2019s Tank Scenic Road from here is one of the best in the park. There is a small parking lot right in front. If you want to see the epic views of the Valley of Fire State Park, you\u2019ll have to climb up a 64ft rock formation. This giant rock formation is located right next to the parking lot. It looks sketchy but it is definitely doable. You just have to take your time and be safe. The view from the top here is definitely worth that short climb. If you\u2019re up for some hiking, the trailhead to Rainbow Vista/Fire Canyon Overlook is located right next to the restroom. It is an easy 1.75 mile loop.\n\n\u301073\u2020 \u3011 \u301074\u2020 \u3011 \u301075\u2020 \u3011 \u301076\u2020 \u3011 \u301077\u2020 \u3011 ", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 73, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}], "content_references": [{"matched_text": "\u301070\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 519, "end_idx": 530, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "Travel Like a Tourist: Williams | Visit Arizona", "url": "https://www.visitarizona.com/like-a-local/travel-like-a-tourist-williams/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nThe rooms have since been transformed into \u301012\u2020Red Garter Inn\u2020www.redgarter.com\u3011\u2014a cozy inn complete with Victorian decor, private baths and a resident ghost or two.

This is where you can see up close and personal to petroglyphs that are thousands of years old, on top of a tall platform. The view up there is pretty cool too! \n\n\u301048\u2020 \u3011 \u301049\u2020 \u3011 \n\n###   \nArch Rock \n\nCoordinates: \u301050\u202036\u00b025\u201918.5\u2033N 114\u00b033\u201916.2\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nArch Rock is a short drive from Atlatl Rock on Campground Road. It is a small arch right off the side of the road. You can walk around to the back of the rock for a better angle. However, since arch rocks are usually very fragile, especially the smaller ones, please don\u2019t climb on it. To be honest, there are way better arch rocks out there, especially if you\u2019ve been to Arches or \u301051\u2020Joshua Tree National Park\u3011. However, it is still nice to visit if you\u2019re in the area. \n\n\u301052\u2020 \u3011 \n\n###   \nFire Cave/Windstone Arch \n\nCoordinates: \u301053\u202036\u00b024\u201944.9\u2033N 114\u00b033\u201914.4\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nFire Cave and Windstone Arch are also located on Campground Road. Campground Road is a loop that will take you back onto the main Valley of Fire Highway. The road turns into an unpaved, washboard road after Arch Rock. It can get very bumpy. This place is my favorite out of all the other stops. Here, you can explore a super cool wind cave called Fire Cave. It\u2019s not hard to find but kind of confusing because there are many other wind caves around. You can see it right off the road if you know where to look. The Windstone Arch is a small arch off in the distance, to the right of the Fire Cave. There are so many other things to explore here. We ran out of time so we didn\u2019t have a chance to really look around. However, we would love to on our next visit.\n\n\u301054\u2020 \u3011 \u301055\u2020 \u3011 \u301056\u2020 \u3011 \u301057\u2020 \u3011 \u301058\u2020 \u3011 \u301059\u2020 \u3011 \n\n###   \nSeven Sisters \n\nCoordinates: \u301060\u202036\u00b025\u201935.5\u2033N 114\u00b030\u201908.2\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nSeven Sisters are yes, you guess it, seven towering red, eroded boulders surround by the sandy desert. At one time, they were a part of the nearby red formations. Because of the relentless forces of erosion, these rock towers are all that remain. This is a good place to stop for a quick lunch or picnics since there are tables and restrooms here. \n\n[Image 4]Photo Credit: Deanna Swaney\n\n###   \nElephant Rock \n\nCoordinates: \u301061\u202036\u00b025\u201941.3\u2033N 114\u00b027\u201936.7\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nElephant Rock is one of the most popular rock formations at Valley of Fire State Park. It is the closest to the East Entrance to the park. If you pay attention, you can see Elephant Rock on the side of the road. The coordinates above show where the actual rock is. Parking for this spot is just right before it. Please, do not park on the shoulders. There are trails to take you to the front and behind the formation. The view is definitely better from the back. \n\n\u301062\u2020 \u3011 \u301063\u2020 \u3011 \u301064\u2020 \u3011 \n\n###   \nMouse\u2019s Tank Scenic Road \n\nCoordinates: \u301065\u202036\u00b025\u201943.0\u2033N 114\u00b030\u201950.2\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nIf you\u2019re visiting Valley of Fire State Park, you have to drive through Mouse\u2019s Tank Scenic Road. Not only this scenic road will take you to most of the epic hikes in the park such as the \u301066\u2020Fire Wave\u3011 or \u301067\u2020Pastel/Pink Canyon\u3011, but it\u2019s also a breathtaking drive. Mouse\u2019s Tank snakes through bright red narrow canyons, stunning viewpoints, and colorful rocks. It starts at the Visitor Center and ends at White Domes trailhead. This road is only 5.7 miles long. \n\n\u301068\u2020 \u3011 \u301069\u2020 \u3011 \u301070\u2020 \u3011 \u301071\u2020 \u3011 \n\n###   \nRainbow Vista Viewpoint \n\nCoordinates: \u301072\u202036\u00b027\u201901.3\u2033N 114\u00b030\u201955.1\u2033W\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nThe view of Mouse\u2019s Tank Scenic Road from here is one of the best in the park. There is a small parking lot right in front. If you want to see the epic views of the Valley of Fire State Park, you\u2019ll have to climb up a 64ft rock formation. This giant rock formation is located right next to the parking lot. It looks sketchy but it is definitely doable. You just have to take your time and be safe. The view from the top here is definitely worth that short climb. If you\u2019re up for some hiking, the trailhead to Rainbow Vista/Fire Canyon Overlook is located right next to the restroom. It is an easy 1.75 mile loop.\n\n\u301073\u2020 \u3011 \u301074\u2020 \u3011 \u301075\u2020 \u3011 \u301076\u2020 \u3011 \u301077\u2020 \u3011 "}], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "2e2e182c-8a27-4203-8e89-8b460e2ab87f", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8d306de58f3d057e-IAD", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "2e2e182c-8a27-4203-8e89-8b460e2ab87f", "children": ["aaa26e0c-74ba-4c0e-816d-f33ee7d8e495"]}, "aaa26e0c-74ba-4c0e-816d-f33ee7d8e495": {"id": "aaa26e0c-74ba-4c0e-816d-f33ee7d8e495", "message": {"id": "aaa26e0c-74ba-4c0e-816d-f33ee7d8e495", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729001855.044505, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["yes please continue, and enhance the categories for the entire list"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8d306ef89bbe057e-IAD", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "3d6c914f-7c7d-41aa-ad65-e763804a92c5", "children": ["bea52b35-f56c-4c5e-b42a-92d187d0abab"]}, "bea52b35-f56c-4c5e-b42a-92d187d0abab": {"id": "bea52b35-f56c-4c5e-b42a-92d187d0abab", "message": {"id": "bea52b35-f56c-4c5e-b42a-92d187d0abab", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729001875.277031, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "response_format_name": null, "text": "search(&quot;San Francisco City Hall, USS Lexington Museum On The Bay, Brevard Zoo, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Museum tourist categories&quot;)"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "aaa26e0c-74ba-4c0e-816d-f33ee7d8e495", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200007]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8d306ef89bbe057e-IAD", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa26e0c-74ba-4c0e-816d-f33ee7d8e495", "children": ["bdc2a5c5-3dc1-40fd-bd75-88bb9986089d"]}, "bdc2a5c5-3dc1-40fd-bd75-88bb9986089d": {"id": "bdc2a5c5-3dc1-40fd-bd75-88bb9986089d", "message": {"id": "bdc2a5c5-3dc1-40fd-bd75-88bb9986089d", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729001875.277189, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_browsing_display", "result": "# \u30100\u2020List of museums in the San Francisco Bay Area - Wikipedia\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011\nwebsite, ceramic and metal sculptures by Clayton Bailey, watercolor drawings by Betty Bailey, and pseudo-scientific curiosities by his alter-ego Dr. Gladstone.

II\n\n[\u3010116\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n[Image 6]Lexington in her original configuration, November 1943\n\nThe ship was laid down as Cabot on 15 July 1941 by \u301076\u2020Fore River Shipyard\u3011 in \u3010117\u2020Quincy, Massachusetts\u3011. In May 1942, \u301075\u2020USS Lexington (CV-2)\u3011, which had been built in the same shipyard two decades earlier, was sunk at the \u3010118\u2020Battle of the Coral Sea\u3011. In June, workers at the shipyard submitted a request to Navy Secretary \u3010119\u2020Frank Knox\u3011 to change the name of a carrier currently under construction there to Lexington.[ 4 ] Knox agreed to the proposal and Cabot was renamed Lexington on 16 June 1942, the fifth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of the \u3010120\u2020Revolutionary War\u3011 \u301074\u2020Battle of Lexington\u3011.[ 1 ][ 5 ] She was launched on 23 September 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Theodore Douglas Robinson. Lexington was \u3010121\u2020commissioned\u3011 on 17 February 1943, with \u3010122\u2020Captain\u3011 \u3010123\u2020Felix Stump\u3011 in command.[ 5 ] After a shakedown cruise in the \u3010124\u2020Caribbean\u3011, Lexington sailed via the \u3010125\u2020Panama Canal\u3011 to join the Pacific fleet. \n\nOne of the carrier&#x27;s first casualties was 1939 \u3010126\u2020Heisman Trophy\u3011 winner \u3010127\u2020Nile Kinnick\u3011. During the ship&#x27;s initial voyage (to the Caribbean) in 1943, Kinnick and other naval fliers were conducting training flights off her deck. The \u3010128\u2020Grumman F4F Wildcat\u3011 flown by Kinnick developed a serious oil leak while airborne and was unable to return to Lexington, crashing into the sea four miles from the ship.[ 6 ] Neither Kinnick nor his plane were recovered. [ 7 ]\n\nLexington arrived at \u3010129\u2020Pearl Harbor\u3011 on 9 August 1943, and participated in a raid on \u3010130\u2020Tarawa\u3011 air bases in late September, followed by a raid against \u3010131\u2020Wake Island\u3011 in October, before returning to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the \u3010132\u2020Gilbert Islands operation\u3011. From 19 to 24 November, she made searches and flew sorties in the \u3010133\u2020Marshalls\u3011, covering the landings in the Gilberts. Her aviators downed 29 enemy aircraft on 23 and 24 November. \n\n#### Kwajalein raid\n\n[\u3010134\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n[Image 7]Chart room on board Lexington as the ship maneuvers during a strike on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, December 1943\n\nLexington sailed to raid \u3010135\u2020Kwajalein\u3011 on 4 December. Her morning strike destroyed the \u3010136\u2020SS Kembu Maru\u3011, damaged two cruisers, and accounted for 30 enemy aircraft. Her gunners splashed two of the enemy torpedo planes that attacked at midday, but were ordered not to open fire at night as Admiral \u3010137\u2020Charles Pownall\u3011 then in command believed it would give their position away (he was later replaced[ 8 ]). \n\nAt 19:20 that night, a major air attack began while the task force was under way off Kwajalein. At 23:22, parachute flares from Japanese planes silhouetted the carrier, and 10 minutes later, she was hit by a torpedo on the starboard side, knocking out her steering gear. Nine people were killed, two on the fantail and seven in the chief petty officers&#x27; mess room, which was a repair party station during general quarters. Four members of the affected repair party survived because they were sitting on a couch that apparently absorbed the shock of the explosion. Settling 5 feet (2\u00a0m) by the stern, the carrier began circling to port amidst dense clouds of smoke pouring from ruptured tanks aft. To maintain water-tight integrity, damage control crews were ordered to seal the damaged compartments and welded them shut, applying heavy steel plates where needed. An emergency hand-operated steering unit was quickly devised, and Lexington made Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs, arriving on 9 December. She reached \u3010138\u2020Bremerton, Washington\u3011, on 22 December for full repairs, completed on 20 February 1944. The error in judgment concerning opening fire at night was never repeated, as thereafter gun crews were ordered to open fire anytime the ship came under attack. Following this attack, the ship was reported as sunk by Japan&#x27;s \u3010139\u2020Tokyo Rose\u3011, the first of several such assertions. \n\n#### Battle of the Philippine Sea\n\n[\u3010140\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nMain article: \u3010141\u2020Battle of the Philippine Sea\u3011\n\nLexington returned to \u3010142\u2020Majuro\u3011 in time to be present when \u3010143\u2020Rear Admiral\u3011 Mitscher took command of the newly formed \u3010144\u2020Task Force 58\u3011 (TF 58) on 8 March. Mitscher took Lexington as his flagship, and after a warm-up strike against \u3010145\u2020Mille\u3011, the Fast Carrier Task Force began a series of operations against the Japanese positions in the central Pacific. She supported Army landings at \u3010146\u2020Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)\u3011 on 13 April, and then raided the strongpoint of \u3010147\u2020Truk\u3011 on 28 April. Heavy counterattacks left Lexington untouched, her planes splashing 17 enemy fighters, but for the second time, Japanese propaganda announced her sunk. \n\nA surprise fighter strike on \u3010148\u2020Saipan", "title": "USS Lexington (CV-16) - Wikipedia", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "USS Lexington (CV-16) - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Lexington_(CV-16)", "text": "\n## Service history\n\n[\u3010115\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n### World War II\n\n[\u3010116\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n[Image 6]Lexington in her original configuration, November 1943\n\nThe ship was laid down as Cabot on 15 July 1941 by \u301076\u2020Fore River Shipyard\u3011 in \u3010117\u2020Quincy, Massachusetts\u3011.

Lexington was \u3010121\u2020commissioned\u3011 on 17 February 1943, with \u3010122\u2020Captain\u3011 \u3010123\u2020Felix Stump\u3011 in command.[ 5 ] After a shakedown cruise in the \u3010124\u2020Caribbean\u3011, Lexington sailed via the \u3010125\u2020Panama Canal\u3011 to join the Pacific fleet. \n\nOne of the carrier&#x27;s first casualties was 1939 \u3010126\u2020Heisman Trophy\u3011 winner \u3010127\u2020Nile Kinnick\u3011. During the ship&#x27;s initial voyage (to the Caribbean) in 1943, Kinnick and other naval fliers were conducting training flights off her deck. The \u3010128\u2020Grumman F4F Wildcat\u3011 flown by Kinnick developed a serious oil leak while airborne and was unable to return to Lexington, crashing into the sea four miles from the ship.[ 6 ] Neither Kinnick nor his plane were recovered. [ 7 ]\n\nLexington arrived at \u3010129\u2020Pearl Harbor\u3011 on 9 August 1943, and participated in a raid on \u3010130\u2020Tarawa\u3011 air bases in late September, followed by a raid against \u3010131\u2020Wake Island\u3011 in October, before returning to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the \u3010132\u2020Gilbert Islands operation\u3011. From 19 to 24 November, she made searches and flew sorties in the \u3010133\u2020Marshalls\u3011, covering the landings in the Gilberts. Her aviators downed 29 enemy aircraft on 23 and 24 November. \n\n#### Kwajalein raid\n\n[\u3010134\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n[Image 7]Chart room on board Lexington as the ship maneuvers during a strike on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, December 1943\n\nLexington sailed to raid \u3010135\u2020Kwajalein\u3011 on 4 December. Her morning strike destroyed the \u3010136\u2020SS Kembu Maru\u3011, damaged two cruisers, and accounted for 30 enemy aircraft. Her gunners splashed two of the enemy torpedo planes that attacked at midday, but were ordered not to open fire at night as Admiral \u3010137\u2020Charles Pownall\u3011 then in command believed it would give their position away (he was later replaced[ 8 ]). \n\nAt 19:20 that night, a major air attack began while the task force was under way off Kwajalein. At 23:22, parachute flares from Japanese planes silhouetted the carrier, and 10 minutes later, she was hit by a torpedo on the starboard side, knocking out her steering gear. Nine people were killed, two on the fantail and seven in the chief petty officers&#x27; mess room, which was a repair party station during general quarters. Four members of the affected repair party survived because they were sitting on a couch that apparently absorbed the shock of the explosion. Settling 5 feet (2\u00a0m) by the stern, the carrier began circling to port amidst dense clouds of smoke pouring from ruptured tanks aft. To maintain water-tight integrity, damage control crews were ordered to seal the damaged compartments and welded them shut, applying heavy steel plates where needed. An emergency hand-operated steering unit was quickly devised, and Lexington made Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs, arriving on 9 December. She reached \u3010138\u2020Bremerton, Washington\u3011, on 22 December for full repairs, completed on 20 February 1944. The error in judgment concerning opening fire at night was never repeated, as thereafter gun crews were ordered to open fire anytime the ship came under attack. Following this attack, the ship was reported as sunk by Japan&#x27;s \u3010139\u2020Tokyo Rose\u3011, the first of several such assertions. \n\n#### Battle of the Philippine Sea\n\n[\u3010140\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nMain article: \u3010141\u2020Battle of the Philippine Sea\u3011\n\nLexington returned to \u3010142\u2020Majuro\u3011 in time to be present when \u3010143\u2020Rear Admiral\u3011 Mitscher took command of the newly formed \u3010144\u2020Task Force 58\u3011 (TF 58) on 8 March. Mitscher took Lexington as his flagship, and after a warm-up strike against \u3010145\u2020Mille\u3011, the Fast Carrier Task Force began a series of operations against the Japanese positions in the central Pacific. She supported Army landings at \u3010146\u2020Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)\u3011 on 13 April, and then raided the strongpoint of \u3010147\u2020Truk\u3011 on 28 April.

They&#x27;re not just giant boats, they&#x27;re entire traveling naval bases that are large enough to house thousands of soldiers and sailors and equipped with the technology to safely and efficiently launch all kinds of air vehicles. When you have a model of engineering on your hands like that, you put it to good use. Even if you have an aircraft carrier that&#x27;s not actively engaging in maritime activities, it wouldn&#x27;t be right to just let it rot in the ocean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch is the story of the oldest remaining Essex-class aircraft carrier, the USS Lexington. Originally created to fight in World War II, the USS Lexington was nearing the end of its operational rope in the late 1980s. Rather than scrap such a majestic vehicle for parts, a concentrated effort between naval forces and the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, resulted in the ship being permanently enshrined off the city&#x27;s coast as a living museum of the United States&#x27; naval and aviation achievements, alongside \u301020\u2020similar museum vessels like the USS Intrepid and the USS Yorktown\u3011\u00a0in New York and South Carolina, respectively.\n\n## The USS Lexington was originally commissioned in 1943\n\n  [Image 1: World War II US aircraft carriers]  Fpg/Getty Images\n\nThe USS Lexington was commissioned near the tail end of World War II in 1943. The vessel originally held the moniker of USS Cabot, but when another carrier with the name Lexington was sunk in the Coral Sea, the Cabot took up its mantle. Following training, the Lexington and its crew were deployed as part of the newly established Central Pacific Force at Pearl Harbor, also known simply as the Fifth Fleet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lexington was in action for a total of 21 months, making appearances at every major naval conflict in the Pacific Theater. Some highlights from the Lexington&#x27;s tenure include a raid on Kwajalein that destroyed a cargo ship and damaged two cruisers, a defensive operation against torpedo planes launched from Guam, and an airfield bombing run prior to the Iwo Jima landings.\u00a0\n\nOn four separate occasions, propagandists for the Axis forces, particularly Japan, falsely reported that the Lexington had been sunk during conflicts. Obviously, this wasn&#x27;t true, so when the ship would reappear in subsequent conflicts, Axis soldiers would be confused by its apparent rising from the dead. This earned the vessel the nickname &quot;The Blue Ghost&quot; from the Japanese Imperial Navy after its ocean blue camouflage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## The USS Lexington has functioned as a naval and aviation museum since 1992\n\n  [Image 2: USS Lexington beach entrance]  vivooo/Shutterstock\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Lexington was temporarily decommissioned, though it was reactivated in 1955 to serve as part of a defensive fleet during a period of heightened tension with Formosa, Laos, and Cuba. Once things cooled down there, the Lexington headed to Pensacola, Florida, in 1962 to serve as a naval training center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lexington remained as a training center until the 1980s, when newer, more advanced ships began to join the naval ranks. It was \u301021\u2020starting to become costly to maintain the Lexington&#x27;s outdated framework\u3011, and it seemed like the vessel was on its way toward the scrap heap. However, that was halted by a proposal from the residents of Corpus Christi, Texas. Urged by the city&#x27;s longstanding support of the Navy, the Corpus Christi City Council approved\u00a0a multi-million-dollar bond to bring the Lexington to the city&#x27;s shores.

They&#x27;re not just giant boats, they&#x27;re entire traveling naval bases that are large enough to house thousands of soldiers and sailors and equipped with the technology to safely and efficiently launch all kinds of air vehicles. When you have a model of engineering on your hands like that, you put it to good use. Even if you have an aircraft carrier that&#x27;s not actively engaging in maritime activities, it wouldn&#x27;t be right to just let it rot in the ocean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch is the story of the oldest remaining Essex-class aircraft carrier, the USS Lexington. Originally created to fight in World War II, the USS Lexington was nearing the end of its operational rope in the late 1980s. Rather than scrap such a majestic vehicle for parts, a concentrated effort between naval forces and the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, resulted in the ship being permanently enshrined off the city&#x27;s coast as a living museum of the United States&#x27; naval and aviation achievements, alongside \u301020\u2020similar museum vessels like the USS Intrepid and the USS Yorktown\u3011\u00a0in New York and South Carolina, respectively.\n\n## The USS Lexington was originally commissioned in 1943\n\n  [Image 1: World War II US aircraft carriers]  Fpg/Getty Images\n\nThe USS Lexington was commissioned near the tail end of World War II in 1943. The vessel originally held the moniker of USS Cabot, but when another carrier with the name Lexington was sunk in the Coral Sea, the Cabot took up its mantle. Following training, the Lexington and its crew were deployed as part of the newly established Central Pacific Force at Pearl Harbor, also known simply as the Fifth Fleet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lexington was in action for a total of 21 months, making appearances at every major naval conflict in the Pacific Theater. Some highlights from the Lexington&#x27;s tenure include a raid on Kwajalein that destroyed a cargo ship and damaged two cruisers, a defensive operation against torpedo planes launched from Guam, and an airfield bombing run prior to the Iwo Jima landings.\u00a0\n\nOn four separate occasions, propagandists for the Axis forces, particularly Japan, falsely reported that the Lexington had been sunk during conflicts. Obviously, this wasn&#x27;t true, so when the ship would reappear in subsequent conflicts, Axis soldiers would be confused by its apparent rising from the dead. This earned the vessel the nickname &quot;The Blue Ghost&quot; from the Japanese Imperial Navy after its ocean blue camouflage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## The USS Lexington has functioned as a naval and aviation museum since 1992\n\n  [Image 2: USS Lexington beach entrance]  vivooo/Shutterstock\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Lexington was temporarily decommissioned, though it was reactivated in 1955 to serve as part of a defensive fleet during a period of heightened tension with Formosa, Laos, and Cuba. Once things cooled down there, the Lexington headed to Pensacola, Florida, in 1962 to serve as a naval training center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lexington remained as a training center until the 1980s, when newer, more advanced ships began to join the naval ranks. It was \u301021\u2020starting to become costly to maintain the Lexington&#x27;s outdated framework\u3011, and it seemed like the vessel was on its way toward the scrap heap. However, that was halted by a proposal from the residents of Corpus Christi, Texas. Urged by the city&#x27;s longstanding support of the Navy, the Corpus Christi City Council approved\u00a0a multi-million-dollar bond to bring the Lexington to the city&#x27;s shores. The purchase was accepted, and in 1992, the Lexington was signed over in full to the city, where it was retooled and opened to the public as a naval museum.\u00a0\n\nThe Lexington, now officially known as the USS Lexington Museum on the Bay, is alive and well to this day as both a museum and an officially designated National Historic Landmark. It maintains a regular rotation of exhibits about naval warfare, as well as some more modern amenities and attractions like escape rooms, a flight simulator, and even a 3D\u00a0theater.

You will get as close as you possibly can to the real thing, complete with sight, sound, and an educational look into the actual action of aviation, flight, and history, thanks to the stadium seating that accommodates 193 people.\n\nIt features a brand-new system which is the world\u2019s most powerful and brilliant cinema projector. This flagship laser projector offers brightness that is comparable to that of the brightest xenon projector. The brightness levels produce an experience that is unmatched in 3D, displaying movies in the exact way the director of the film envisioned them.\n\nIf you have already paid to enter the ship, you do not need to pay again to enter the MEGA Theater. The theater is accessible for guests using wheelchairs and provides closed captioning using CaptiView for guests who have hearing impairments.\n\n### The Scale Model\n\nThe gallery of scale model pieces in the ship will astonish individuals who have a passion for warplanes, ships, and the stories that are represented by them. This is the largest scale model collection that has ever been shown to the public in Texas. It took five years to put together, and there are more than 440 pieces on display.\n\nThis must-see exhibit was created by over 120 skilled volunteers who worked together to create it over the course of many thousands of hours. The exhibition features work by artists from 16 states in the United States and 5 countries from around the world.

In May 1942, \u301075\u2020USS Lexington (CV-2)\u3011, which had been built in the same shipyard two decades earlier, was sunk at the \u3010118\u2020Battle of the Coral Sea\u3011. In June, workers at the shipyard submitted a request to Navy Secretary \u3010119\u2020Frank Knox\u3011 to change the name of a carrier currently under construction there to Lexington.[ 4 ] Knox agreed to the proposal and Cabot was renamed Lexington on 16 June 1942, the fifth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of the \u3010120\u2020Revolutionary War\u3011 \u301074\u2020Battle of Lexington\u3011.[ 1 ][ 5 ] She was launched on 23 September 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Theodore Douglas Robinson. Lexington was \u3010121\u2020commissioned\u3011 on 17 February 1943, with \u3010122\u2020Captain\u3011 \u3010123\u2020Felix Stump\u3011 in command.[ 5 ] After a shakedown cruise in the \u3010124\u2020Caribbean\u3011, Lexington sailed via the \u3010125\u2020Panama Canal\u3011 to join the Pacific fleet. \n\nOne of the carrier&#x27;s first casualties was 1939 \u3010126\u2020Heisman Trophy\u3011 winner \u3010127\u2020Nile Kinnick\u3011. During the ship&#x27;s initial voyage (to the Caribbean) in 1943, Kinnick and other naval fliers were conducting training flights off her deck. The \u3010128\u2020Grumman F4F Wildcat\u3011 flown by Kinnick developed a serious oil leak while airborne and was unable to return to Lexington, crashing into the sea four miles from the ship.[ 6 ] Neither Kinnick nor his plane were recovered. [ 7 ]\n\nLexington arrived at \u3010129\u2020Pearl Harbor\u3011 on 9 August 1943, and participated in a raid on \u3010130\u2020Tarawa\u3011 air bases in late September, followed by a raid against \u3010131\u2020Wake Island\u3011 in October, before returning to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the \u3010132\u2020Gilbert Islands operation\u3011. From 19 to 24 November, she made searches and flew sorties in the \u3010133\u2020Marshalls\u3011, covering the landings in the Gilberts. Her aviators downed 29 enemy aircraft on 23 and 24 November. \n\n#### Kwajalein raid\n\n[\u3010134\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n[Image 7]Chart room on board Lexington as the ship maneuvers during a strike on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, December 1943\n\nLexington sailed to raid \u3010135\u2020Kwajalein\u3011 on 4 December. Her morning strike destroyed the \u3010136\u2020SS Kembu Maru\u3011, damaged two cruisers, and accounted for 30 enemy aircraft. Her gunners splashed two of the enemy torpedo planes that attacked at midday, but were ordered not to open fire at night as Admiral \u3010137\u2020Charles Pownall\u3011 then in command believed it would give their position away (he was later replaced[ 8 ]). \n\nAt 19:20 that night, a major air attack began while the task force was under way off Kwajalein. At 23:22, parachute flares from Japanese planes silhouetted the carrier, and 10 minutes later, she was hit by a torpedo on the starboard side, knocking out her steering gear. Nine people were killed, two on the fantail and seven in the chief petty officers&#x27; mess room, which was a repair party station during general quarters. Four members of the affected repair party survived because they were sitting on a couch that apparently absorbed the shock of the explosion. Settling 5 feet (2\u00a0m) by the stern, the carrier began circling to port amidst dense clouds of smoke pouring from ruptured tanks aft. To maintain water-tight integrity, damage control crews were ordered to seal the damaged compartments and welded them shut, applying heavy steel plates where needed. An emergency hand-operated steering unit was quickly devised, and Lexington made Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs, arriving on 9 December.

They&#x27;re not just giant boats, they&#x27;re entire traveling naval bases that are large enough to house thousands of soldiers and sailors and equipped with the technology to safely and efficiently launch all kinds of air vehicles. When you have a model of engineering on your hands like that, you put it to good use. Even if you have an aircraft carrier that&#x27;s not actively engaging in maritime activities, it wouldn&#x27;t be right to just let it rot in the ocean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch is the story of the oldest remaining Essex-class aircraft carrier, the USS Lexington. Originally created to fight in World War II, the USS Lexington was nearing the end of its operational rope in the late 1980s. Rather than scrap such a majestic vehicle for parts, a concentrated effort between naval forces and the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, resulted in the ship being permanently enshrined off the city&#x27;s coast as a living museum of the United States&#x27; naval and aviation achievements, alongside \u301020\u2020similar museum vessels like the USS Intrepid and the USS Yorktown\u3011\u00a0in New York and South Carolina, respectively.\n\n## The USS Lexington was originally commissioned in 1943\n\n  [Image 1: World War II US aircraft carriers]  Fpg/Getty Images\n\nThe USS Lexington was commissioned near the tail end of World War II in 1943. The vessel originally held the moniker of USS Cabot, but when another carrier with the name Lexington was sunk in the Coral Sea, the Cabot took up its mantle. Following training, the Lexington and its crew were deployed as part of the newly established Central Pacific Force at Pearl Harbor, also known simply as the Fifth Fleet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lexington was in action for a total of 21 months, making appearances at every major naval conflict in the Pacific Theater. Some highlights from the Lexington&#x27;s tenure include a raid on Kwajalein that destroyed a cargo ship and damaged two cruisers, a defensive operation against torpedo planes launched from Guam, and an airfield bombing run prior to the Iwo Jima landings.\u00a0\n\nOn four separate occasions, propagandists for the Axis forces, particularly Japan, falsely reported that the Lexington had been sunk during conflicts. Obviously, this wasn&#x27;t true, so when the ship would reappear in subsequent conflicts, Axis soldiers would be confused by its apparent rising from the dead. This earned the vessel the nickname &quot;The Blue Ghost&quot; from the Japanese Imperial Navy after its ocean blue camouflage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## The USS Lexington has functioned as a naval and aviation museum since 1992\n\n  [Image 2: USS Lexington beach entrance]  vivooo/Shutterstock\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Lexington was temporarily decommissioned, though it was reactivated in 1955 to serve as part of a defensive fleet during a period of heightened tension with Formosa, Laos, and Cuba. Once things cooled down there, the Lexington headed to Pensacola, Florida, in 1962 to serve as a naval training center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lexington remained as a training center until the 1980s, when newer, more advanced ships began to join the naval ranks. It was \u301021\u2020starting to become costly to maintain the Lexington&#x27;s outdated framework\u3011, and it seemed like the vessel was on its way toward the scrap heap. However, that was halted by a proposal from the residents of Corpus Christi, Texas. Urged by the city&#x27;s longstanding support of the Navy, the Corpus Christi City Council approved\u00a0a multi-million-dollar bond to bring the Lexington to the city&#x27;s shores. The purchase was accepted, and in 1992, the Lexington was signed over in full to the city, where it was retooled and opened to the public as a naval museum.\u00a0\n\nThe Lexington, now officially known as the USS Lexington Museum on the Bay, is alive and well to this day as both a museum and an officially designated National Historic Landmark. It maintains a regular rotation of exhibits about naval warfare, as well as some more modern amenities and attractions like escape rooms, a flight simulator, and even a 3D\u00a0theater.

6]Lexington in her original configuration, November 1943\n\nThe ship was laid down as Cabot on 15 July 1941 by \u301076\u2020Fore River Shipyard\u3011 in \u3010117\u2020Quincy, Massachusetts\u3011. In May 1942, \u301075\u2020USS Lexington (CV-2)\u3011, which had been built in the same shipyard two decades earlier, was sunk at the \u3010118\u2020Battle of the Coral Sea\u3011. In June, workers at the shipyard submitted a request to Navy Secretary \u3010119\u2020Frank Knox\u3011 to change the name of a carrier currently under construction there to Lexington.[ 4 ] Knox agreed to the proposal and Cabot was renamed Lexington on 16 June 1942, the fifth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of the \u3010120\u2020Revolutionary War\u3011 \u301074\u2020Battle of Lexington\u3011.[ 1 ][ 5 ] She was launched on 23 September 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Theodore Douglas Robinson. Lexington was \u3010121\u2020commissioned\u3011 on 17 February 1943, with \u3010122\u2020Captain\u3011 \u3010123\u2020Felix Stump\u3011 in command.[ 5 ] After a shakedown cruise in the \u3010124\u2020Caribbean\u3011, Lexington sailed via the \u3010125\u2020Panama Canal\u3011 to join the Pacific fleet. \n\nOne of the carrier&#x27;s first casualties was 1939 \u3010126\u2020Heisman Trophy\u3011 winner \u3010127\u2020Nile Kinnick\u3011. During the ship&#x27;s initial voyage (to the Caribbean) in 1943, Kinnick and other naval fliers were conducting training flights off her deck. The \u3010128\u2020Grumman F4F Wildcat\u3011 flown by Kinnick developed a serious oil leak while airborne and was unable to return to Lexington, crashing into the sea four miles from the ship.[ 6 ] Neither Kinnick nor his plane were recovered. [ 7 ]\n\nLexington arrived at \u3010129\u2020Pearl Harbor\u3011 on 9 August 1943, and participated in a raid on \u3010130\u2020Tarawa\u3011 air bases in late September, followed by a raid against \u3010131\u2020Wake Island\u3011 in October, before returning to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the \u3010132\u2020Gilbert Islands operation\u3011. From 19 to 24 November, she made searches and flew sorties in the \u3010133\u2020Marshalls\u3011, covering the landings in the Gilberts. Her aviators downed 29 enemy aircraft on 23 and 24 November. \n\n#### Kwajalein raid\n\n[\u3010134\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n[Image 7]Chart room on board Lexington as the ship maneuvers during a strike on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, December 1943\n\nLexington sailed to raid \u3010135\u2020Kwajalein\u3011 on 4 December. Her morning strike destroyed the \u3010136\u2020SS Kembu Maru\u3011, damaged two cruisers, and accounted for 30 enemy aircraft. Her gunners splashed two of the enemy torpedo planes that attacked at midday, but were ordered not to open fire at night as Admiral \u3010137\u2020Charles Pownall\u3011 then in command believed it would give their position away (he was later replaced[ 8 ]). \n\nAt 19:20 that night, a major air attack began while the task force was under way off Kwajalein. At 23:22, parachute flares from Japanese planes silhouetted the carrier, and 10 minutes later, she was hit by a torpedo on the starboard side, knocking out her steering gear. Nine people were killed, two on the fantail and seven in the chief petty officers&#x27; mess room, which was a repair party station during general quarters. Four members of the affected repair party survived because they were sitting on a couch that apparently absorbed the shock of the explosion. Settling 5 feet (2\u00a0m) by the stern, the carrier began circling to port amidst dense clouds of smoke pouring from ruptured tanks aft. To maintain water-tight integrity, damage control crews were ordered to seal the damaged compartments and welded them shut, applying heavy steel plates where needed. An emergency hand-operated steering unit was quickly devised, and Lexington made Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs, arriving on 9 December. She reached \u3010138\u2020Bremerton, Washington\u3011, on 22 December for full repairs, completed on 20 February 1944. The error in judgment concerning opening fire at night was never repeated, as thereafter gun crews were ordered to open fire anytime the ship came under attack. Following this attack, the ship was reported as sunk by Japan&#x27;s \u3010139\u2020Tokyo Rose\u3011, the first of several such assertions. \n\n#### Battle of the Philippine Sea\n\n[\u3010140\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nMain article: \u3010141\u2020Battle of the Philippine Sea\u3011\n\nLexington returned to \u3010142\u2020Majuro\u3011 in time to be present when \u3010143\u2020Rear Admiral\u3011 Mitscher took command of the newly formed \u3010144\u2020Task Force 58\u3011 (TF 58) on 8 March. Mitscher took Lexington as his flagship, and after a warm-up strike against \u3010145\u2020Mille\u3011, the Fast Carrier Task Force began a series of operations against the Japanese positions in the central Pacific. She supported Army landings at \u3010146\u2020Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)\u3011 on 13 April, and then raided the strongpoint of \u3010147\u2020Truk\u3011 on 28 April. Heavy counterattacks left Lexington untouched, her planes splashing 17 enemy fighters, but for the second time, Japanese propaganda announced her sunk. \n\nA surprise fighter strike on \u3010148\u2020Saipan"}, {"matched_text": "\u301082\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 412, "end_idx": 423, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "What US Aircraft Carrier Turned Museum Is Docked In Corpus Christi, Texas?", "url": "https://www.slashgear.com/1641892/corpus-christi-aircraft-carrier-uss-lexington-museum-about/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011 \n\n  * \u30101\u2020News\u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020Tech\u3011\n  * \u30103\u2020Cars\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Entertainment\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Science\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020Reviews\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020Health\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Features\u3011\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \u30109\u2020Newsletter\u2020subscribe.slashgear.com\u3011\n  * \u301010\u2020Advertise\u2020static.com\u3011\n\n  * \u301011\u2020About\u3011\n  * \u301012\u2020Editorial Policies\u3011\n  * \u301013\u2020Reviews Policy\u3011\n  * \u301014\u2020Our Experts\u3011\n  * \u301015\u2020Privacy Policy\u2020www.static.com\u3011 \n  * \u301016\u2020Terms of Use\u2020www.static.com\u3011\n\n\u00a9 2024 \u301017\u2020Static Media\u2020www.static.com\u3011.

They&#x27;re not just giant boats, they&#x27;re entire traveling naval bases that are large enough to house thousands of soldiers and sailors and equipped with the technology to safely and efficiently launch all kinds of air vehicles. When you have a model of engineering on your hands like that, you put it to good use. Even if you have an aircraft carrier that&#x27;s not actively engaging in maritime activities, it wouldn&#x27;t be right to just let it rot in the ocean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch is the story of the oldest remaining Essex-class aircraft carrier, the USS Lexington. Originally created to fight in World War II, the USS Lexington was nearing the end of its operational rope in the late 1980s. Rather than scrap such a majestic vehicle for parts, a concentrated effort between naval forces and the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, resulted in the ship being permanently enshrined off the city&#x27;s coast as a living museum of the United States&#x27; naval and aviation achievements, alongside \u301020\u2020similar museum vessels like the USS Intrepid and the USS Yorktown\u3011\u00a0in New York and South Carolina, respectively.\n\n## The USS Lexington was originally commissioned in 1943\n\n  [Image 1: World War II US aircraft carriers]  Fpg/Getty Images\n\nThe USS Lexington was commissioned near the tail end of World War II in 1943. The vessel originally held the moniker of USS Cabot, but when another carrier with the name Lexington was sunk in the Coral Sea, the Cabot took up its mantle. Following training, the Lexington and its crew were deployed as part of the newly established Central Pacific Force at Pearl Harbor, also known simply as the Fifth Fleet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lexington was in action for a total of 21 months, making appearances at every major naval conflict in the Pacific Theater. Some highlights from the Lexington&#x27;s tenure include a raid on Kwajalein that destroyed a cargo ship and damaged two cruisers, a defensive operation against torpedo planes launched from Guam, and an airfield bombing run prior to the Iwo Jima landings.\u00a0\n\nOn four separate occasions, propagandists for the Axis forces, particularly Japan, falsely reported that the Lexington had been sunk during conflicts. Obviously, this wasn&#x27;t true, so when the ship would reappear in subsequent conflicts, Axis soldiers would be confused by its apparent rising from the dead. This earned the vessel the nickname &quot;The Blue Ghost&quot; from the Japanese Imperial Navy after its ocean blue camouflage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## The USS Lexington has functioned as a naval and aviation museum since 1992\n\n  [Image 2: USS Lexington beach entrance]  vivooo/Shutterstock\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Lexington was temporarily decommissioned, though it was reactivated in 1955 to serve as part of a defensive fleet during a period of heightened tension with Formosa, Laos, and Cuba. Once things cooled down there, the Lexington headed to Pensacola, Florida, in 1962 to serve as a naval training center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lexington remained as a training center until the 1980s, when newer, more advanced ships began to join the naval ranks. It was \u301021\u2020starting to become costly to maintain the Lexington&#x27;s outdated framework\u3011, and it seemed like the vessel was on its way toward the scrap heap. However, that was halted by a proposal from the residents of Corpus Christi, Texas. Urged by the city&#x27;s longstanding support of the Navy, the Corpus Christi City Council approved\u00a0a multi-million-dollar bond to bring the Lexington to the city&#x27;s shores. The purchase was accepted, and in 1992, the Lexington was signed over in full to the city, where it was retooled and opened to the public as a naval museum.\u00a0\n\nThe Lexington, now officially known as the USS Lexington Museum on the Bay, is alive and well to this day as both a museum and an officially designated National Historic Landmark. It maintains a regular rotation of exhibits about naval warfare, as well as some more modern amenities and attractions like escape rooms, a flight simulator, and even a 3D\u00a0theater.

Three separate stages host a monstrous array of stand-ups more or less every night of the week, and its long showcases are known for headline-worthy drop-ins (just maybe cash out your two-drink minimum tab before the doldrums of the last hour of the show).\n\n\u301047\u2020Buy ticket\u2020thecomedystore.com\u3011\n\n\u301048\u20202.

From Wednesday to Sunday, you can tour the house ($10 with a reservation) and imagine yourself as part of the freewheeling L.A. bohemia of the 1920s and \u201930s.\n\n\u301049\u2020Book online\u2020app.acuityscheduling.com\u3011\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u301050\u20203.

Three separate stages host a monstrous array of stand-ups more or less every night of the week, and its long showcases are known for headline-worthy drop-ins (just maybe cash out your two-drink minimum tab before the doldrums of the last hour of the show).\n\n\u301047\u2020Buy ticket\u2020thecomedystore.com\u3011\n\n\u301048\u20202.

These days, it\u2019s home to the MAK Center, a Vienna-based institute that runs a fantastic program of events in the space (think experimental fashion shows, innovative performance art and concerts of new compositions). From Wednesday to Sunday, you can tour the house ($10 with a reservation) and imagine yourself as part of the freewheeling L.A. bohemia of the 1920s and \u201930s.\n\n\u301049\u2020Book online\u2020app.acuityscheduling.com\u3011\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u301050\u20203.

It hasn\u2019t lapsed into irrelevance in the time since, and you\u2019ll see on-the-rise bands sell out the space on a weekly basis as well as once-in-a-while intimate sets from arena-sized bands.

The city painted two rainbow crosswalks on\u00a0San Vicente Boulevard (at Santa Monica Boulevard) in late 2012, and ever since it seems nearly impossible to imagine the area without them. In 2022, WeHo added brown and black stripes to the crosswalks for inclusivity, as well as blue, pink and white to represent the transgender flag.\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u301053\u20205.

WE DARE YOU TO SEE THEM ALL!\n\nIn no way is this a comprehensive list of all the incredible experiences to explore in Seattle, but it\u2019s a start. Let\u2019s go!\n\n## THINGS TO DO AT SEATTLE CENTER\n\nSeattle Center is a vibrant hub of culture and entertainment. Whether you\u2019re into art, science, or history, Seattle has something for everyone.\n\nAt its heart stands the iconic Space Needle, offering breathtaking city views. Nearby, the Museum of Pop Culture celebrates music and pop culture in a striking building. \n\nScience enthusiasts will love the hands-on exhibits at the Pacific Science Center. For a unique experience, ride the historic Monorail. Or, marvel at the colorful glass sculptures at Chihuly Garden and Glass.\n\n[Image 1] Photo: David Newman\n\n## 1. Space Needle\n\nBuilt for the 1962 World\u2019s Fair, the 605-foot-tall \u301078\u2020Space Needle\u3011 quickly became an icon of the city that today is recognized far and wide. On the observation level, which you can reach via a 43-second elevator ride, see the doodle-on-a-napkin concept that led to the Space Needle design. Views from the top feature Elliott Bay, the Cascade Mountains, and even Mount Rainier.\n\n[Image 2] \n\n## 2. Seattle Center Monorail\n\nAnother World\u2019s Fair relic, the \u301079\u2020Seattle Center Monorail\u3011 links Seattle Center\u2014home of the Space Needle and several other notable attractions\u2014to downtown\u2019s Westlake Center along an approximately one-mile route. The designated historic landmark can reach a top speed of 45 miles per hour and weaves between skyscrapers above the city streets.\n\n[Image 3] Photo: Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP) | Brady Harvey\n\n## 3. Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP)\n\nMusic, science fiction, and pop culture all come together at the fascinating \u301080\u2020Museum of Pop Culture\u3011. The Frank Gehry-designed building looks like a smashed guitar from above, while inside, its colorful exhibits cover everything from the history of indie video games and horror films to Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, and more.\n\n###### Sponsored Message\n\n\u301081\u2020 \u2020www.citypass.com\u3011 \n\n##   \n\nLooking for the best things to do in Seattle?

These shopping areas provide a dense concentration of shopping, dining, and overnight accommodations. Alongside unique and name-brand shopping opportunities, the Bellevue Collection also offers seasonal events that draw a crowd.\n\nThe Bellevue Collection includes the Bellevue Square shopping mall with more than 200 retail storefronts in a spacious and well-lit space. Lincoln Square is also included in the collection and has several cultural dining destinations. The third shopping area, Bellevue Place, has some of the best places to stay. The Bellevue Collection hosts everything you need in a few blocks to keep yourself busy for many long weekends.\n\n[Image 11: Bellevue Square shopping mall]Bellevue Square shopping mall | Photo Copyright: Brad Lane \n\nThis part of town is especially festive during the holiday season. The Bellevue Collection organizes Snowflake Lane throughout December. This family fun celebration is outside the Bellevue Square shopping mall, where the street is alive with glittering lights, electronic animations, and always falling snow.\n\nAddress: 575 Bellevue Square, Bellevue, Washington\n\nOfficial site: \u301032\u2020http://bellevuecollection.com/\u2020bellevuecollection.com\u3011\n\n## Lake Sammamish\n\n[Image 12: Lake Sammamish]Lake Sammamish \n\nWhile Lake Sammamish may seem like a puddle compared to the far-spreading waters of Lake Washington to the west, it looks massive when you&#x27;re standing on its shores. This body of water provides important recreational opportunities for Bellevue residents and its connected communities.\n\nIn Bellevue, on the eastern shore of Lake Sammamish, Vasa Park Resort provides picnic areas; boat launches; and a perfect spot to swim, with diving boards and waterslides. Vasa Park is also a popular spot to pitch a tent or park an RV.\n\nMarymoor Park is on the north end of Lake Sammamish, connected to the city of Redmond. I know Marymoor Park best for its awesome outdoor concert series. Marymoor&#x27;s Summer Concert Series occurs throughout the week between June and August. A public water-skiing slalom course is also on the north end of the lake. \n\nLake Sammamish State Park in Issaquah offers outdoor adventures throughout the year on the southern shore,\n\nAddress: 3560 W Lake Sammamish Pkwy SE, Bellevue, Washington\n\n## Sneak in 18 Holes of Golf \n\n[Image 13: The Golf Club at Newcastle]The Golf Club at Newcastle | \u301033\u2020Andy Blackledge\u2020www.flickr.com\u3011 / photo modified \n\nSeveral of Western Washington&#x27;s top golf courses are in or within a short drive of Bellevue. These courses serve the region as a whole and not just Bellevue residents, so advanced tee times are always recommended.\n\nThe Golf Club at Newcastle offers arguably some of the best golf in the Pacific Northwest, less than a 12-mile drive from downtown. This club is open to the public and offers 36 holes of championship golf. The facility encompasses 350 acres perched atop the foothills of Cougar Mountain Regional Park. This high vantage point lends to incredible views of the Seattle skyline and landscapes, including Mount Rainier and the Olympic Mountains.\n\nBellevue also maintains the Bellevue Golf Course. This public course offers more affordable rates closer to town. It doesn&#x27;t skimp on scenery, though, and the course has a reputation for its well-maintained landscaping and greens. A popular driving range is also on-site.\n\nThe city also oversees the Crossroads Par-3 Course on the east side of town. This nine-hole putt-and-chip course is open from April through October. It&#x27;s a great place to visit for a quick golf outing, catering to experienced players looking to perfect their short game or those new to the sport.\n\n## Bellevue Zip Tour\n\nFor a unique way to explore the natural side of Bellevue, the Bellevue Zip Tour takes visitors speeding among Douglas firs and broadleaf maples as they explore the scenery from above. This city-owned facility consists of 6.5 ziplines, ranging from 70 to 450 feet, and operates every season except in the winter.\n\nThe Bellevue Zip Tour is just west of the South Bellevue Community Center. Whether looking for a fun time for the whole family or a great place for a group getaway, it provides a fast-flying way to see some Pacific Northwest nature from a new perspective.\n\nAddress: 450 110th Ave. NE, Bellevue, Washington\n\nOfficial site: \u301034\u2020http://www.bellevueziptour.com/\u2020www.bellevueziptour.com\u3011\n\n## Day Trip to Seattle\n\n[Image 14: Seattle skyline]Seattle skyline \n\nIt&#x27;s only a 15-minute drive across Lake Washington to the Emerald City from Bellevue or, if you&#x27;re like me and prefer to leave the car parked, a 30-minute bus ride. If you&#x27;re visiting Bellevue and have some extra time on your hands, it&#x27;s well worth the trip across the lake to check out this cultural capital of the Pacific Northwest. \n\nIconic spots like the Space Needle and Pike Place Market are well worth the visit, but Seattle is so much more than these two iconic attractions. Peel back the layers of the city with a day of exploring beach parks, international districts, and gardens of glass.

These shopping areas provide a dense concentration of shopping, dining, and overnight accommodations. Alongside unique and name-brand shopping opportunities, the Bellevue Collection also offers seasonal events that draw a crowd.\n\nThe Bellevue Collection includes the Bellevue Square shopping mall with more than 200 retail storefronts in a spacious and well-lit space. Lincoln Square is also included in the collection and has several cultural dining destinations. The third shopping area, Bellevue Place, has some of the best places to stay. The Bellevue Collection hosts everything you need in a few blocks to keep yourself busy for many long weekends.\n\n[Image 11: Bellevue Square shopping mall]Bellevue Square shopping mall | Photo Copyright: Brad Lane \n\nThis part of town is especially festive during the holiday season. The Bellevue Collection organizes Snowflake Lane throughout December. This family fun celebration is outside the Bellevue Square shopping mall, where the street is alive with glittering lights, electronic animations, and always falling snow.\n\nAddress: 575 Bellevue Square, Bellevue, Washington\n\nOfficial site: \u301032\u2020http://bellevuecollection.com/\u2020bellevuecollection.com\u3011\n\n## Lake Sammamish\n\n[Image 12: Lake Sammamish]Lake Sammamish \n\nWhile Lake Sammamish may seem like a puddle compared to the far-spreading waters of Lake Washington to the west, it looks massive when you&#x27;re standing on its shores. This body of water provides important recreational opportunities for Bellevue residents and its connected communities.\n\nIn Bellevue, on the eastern shore of Lake Sammamish, Vasa Park Resort provides picnic areas; boat launches; and a perfect spot to swim, with diving boards and waterslides. Vasa Park is also a popular spot to pitch a tent or park an RV.\n\nMarymoor Park is on the north end of Lake Sammamish, connected to the city of Redmond. I know Marymoor Park best for its awesome outdoor concert series. Marymoor&#x27;s Summer Concert Series occurs throughout the week between June and August. A public water-skiing slalom course is also on the north end of the lake. \n\nLake Sammamish State Park in Issaquah offers outdoor adventures throughout the year on the southern shore,\n\nAddress: 3560 W Lake Sammamish Pkwy SE, Bellevue, Washington\n\n## Sneak in 18 Holes of Golf \n\n[Image 13: The Golf Club at Newcastle]The Golf Club at Newcastle | \u301033\u2020Andy Blackledge\u2020www.flickr.com\u3011 / photo modified \n\nSeveral of Western Washington&#x27;s top golf courses are in or within a short drive of Bellevue. These courses serve the region as a whole and not just Bellevue residents, so advanced tee times are always recommended.\n\nThe Golf Club at Newcastle offers arguably some of the best golf in the Pacific Northwest, less than a 12-mile drive from downtown. This club is open to the public and offers 36 holes of championship golf. The facility encompasses 350 acres perched atop the foothills of Cougar Mountain Regional Park. This high vantage point lends to incredible views of the Seattle skyline and landscapes, including Mount Rainier and the Olympic Mountains.\n\nBellevue also maintains the Bellevue Golf Course. This public course offers more affordable rates closer to town. It doesn&#x27;t skimp on scenery, though, and the course has a reputation for its well-maintained landscaping and greens. A popular driving range is also on-site.\n\nThe city also oversees the Crossroads Par-3 Course on the east side of town. This nine-hole putt-and-chip course is open from April through October. It&#x27;s a great place to visit for a quick golf outing, catering to experienced players looking to perfect their short game or those new to the sport.\n\n## Bellevue Zip Tour\n\nFor a unique way to explore the natural side of Bellevue, the Bellevue Zip Tour takes visitors speeding among Douglas firs and broadleaf maples as they explore the scenery from above. This city-owned facility consists of 6.5 ziplines, ranging from 70 to 450 feet, and operates every season except in the winter.\n\nThe Bellevue Zip Tour is just west of the South Bellevue Community Center. Whether looking for a fun time for the whole family or a great place for a group getaway, it provides a fast-flying way to see some Pacific Northwest nature from a new perspective.\n\nAddress: 450 110th Ave. NE, Bellevue, Washington\n\nOfficial site: \u301034\u2020http://www.bellevueziptour.com/\u2020www.bellevueziptour.com\u3011\n\n## Day Trip to Seattle\n\n[Image 14: Seattle skyline]Seattle skyline \n\nIt&#x27;s only a 15-minute drive across Lake Washington to the Emerald City from Bellevue or, if you&#x27;re like me and prefer to leave the car parked, a 30-minute bus ride. If you&#x27;re visiting Bellevue and have some extra time on your hands, it&#x27;s well worth the trip across the lake to check out this cultural capital of the Pacific Northwest. \n\nIconic spots like the Space Needle and Pike Place Market are well worth the visit, but Seattle is so much more than these two iconic attractions. Peel back the layers of the city with a day of exploring beach parks, international districts, and gardens of glass.

Located right in the heart of town, its barns, fields and farmhouse lie within a huge community park, surrounded by magnificent forests, meadows and wetlands.\n\nBuilt in the early 1900s, the working farm now highlights what life was like back in those days with its historic old barns and pristine pastures housing pigs, cows, sheep and chickens. Besides seeing all the farmyard animals, there are playgrounds and picnic areas to make use of and countless trails to hike along through the nearby woods and fields.\n\nDuring the summer, Kelsey Creek Farm runs educational programmes for children with pony treks and farm experiences to be enjoyed alongside art, science and nature camps.\n\n## 7.

At its scenic and secluded site, visitors can shoot through the treetops at great speeds and cross swaying suspension bridges with resplendent nature and views lying all around.\n\nEstablished in 2006, its challenge courses, climbing walls and zip lines have proved very popular with locals and tourists alike. There are seven thrilling zip lines and two lofty suspension bridges to navigate strung up between the trees. \n\nAmong its atmospheric old Maple and Douglas Fir forest you can zip along at speeds of up to 55 kph. You can often spot Mount Baker and Glacier Peak through the canopy.\n\n## 6. Meydenbauer Bay Park\n\n[Image 13: Meydenbauer Bay Park][Image 14: Meydenbauer Bay Park]\n\nAlso boasting gorgeous scenery and views is Meydenbauer Bay Park in the center of town. Lying along the serene shores of the big bay of the same name, it offers a host of great outdoor activities, as well as a picture-perfect beach and long pedestrian pier.\n\nFormerly a landing site for passenger ferries in the late 1800s, the lakeside location later became Bellevue\u2019s first park in 1953. Recent renovations have not only extended and expanded its sandy beach but also added a curving pier, which further protects the park\u2019s calm waters and is ideal for ambling along peacefully.\n\nBesides sunbathing, swimming and basking in the phenomenal vistas over Lake Washington, guests can enjoy a pleasant picnic on its viewing terrace, or wander along its nature trails. A play area, canoes and kayaks are also available.\n\n## 5. Bellevue Arts Museum\n\n[Image 15: Bellevue Arts Museum][Image 16: Bellevue Arts Museum]\n\nJust a short walk from both the park and bay is yet another of the city\u2019s top tourist attractions: the outstanding Bellevue Arts Museum. Packed with interesting artworks and exhibits, it lies just across the street from the massive Bellevue Square shopping center.\n\nUnlike almost all art museums, it doesn\u2019t have a permanent collection. All its unique works and thought-provoking exhibitions are temporary in nature. While it is particularly known for its amazing installations by Pacific Northwest artists, the museum is also noted for the extensive number of hands-on classes and workshops it puts on for the community each year.\n\nFounded in 1975, it occupies a striking modern building with its rotating exhibits focussing on everything from fine arts and visual design to cartoons, contemporary crafts and ceramic sculptures.\n\n## 4. Bellevue Square\n\n[Image 17: Bellevue Square][Image 18: Bellevue Square]\n\nThe best place to shop, dine and go out in the city is undoubtedly the ever-popular Bellevue Square, located right next to both the art museum and Downtown Park. With cosmetics and accessories, high fashion clothes, jewellery and luxury items, its endless array of stores certainly have you covered.\n\nSince first opening in 1946, it has expanded enormously and now impressively has over 200 shops and boutiques for visitors to peruse, with both Macy\u2019s and Nordstrum anchoring the mall. Here countless cafes and restaurants serve up delicious dishes from all around the world, with outdoor and open-air dining both being on offer.\n\nBesides shopping \u2018til you drop and sampling tasty treats, you can also go bowling, stop by its state-of-the-art cinema or enjoy some splendid live music at one of its numerous bars and clubs.\n\n## 3. Mercer Slough Nature Park\n\n[Image 19: Mercer Slough Nature Park][Image 20: Mercer Slough Nature Park]\n\nAnother picturesque spot where you can immerse yourself in nature is the lovely, lush Mercer Slough Nature Park. One of the largest parks in the city, it sprawls across a huge site with wonderful wetlands and woods to be found alongside charming creeks, open meadows and agricultural areas.\n\n", "title": "12 Best Things to Do in Bellevue, WA \u2013 Touropia Travel", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "12 Best Things to Do in Bellevue, WA \u2013 Touropia Travel", "url": "https://www.touropia.com/things-to-do-in-bellevue-wa/", "text": "\nAs The Emerald City, and all its enticing attractions, lie fifteen minutes\u2019 drive away, it is well worth going on a day trip from Bellevue.

Meydenbauer Bay Park\n\n[Image 13: Meydenbauer Bay Park][Image 14: Meydenbauer Bay Park]\n\nAlso boasting gorgeous scenery and views is Meydenbauer Bay Park in the center of town. Lying along the serene shores of the big bay of the same name, it offers a host of great outdoor activities, as well as a picture-perfect beach and long pedestrian pier.\n\nFormerly a landing site for passenger ferries in the late 1800s, the lakeside location later became Bellevue\u2019s first park in 1953. Recent renovations have not only extended and expanded its sandy beach but also added a curving pier, which further protects the park\u2019s calm waters and is ideal for ambling along peacefully.\n\nBesides sunbathing, swimming and basking in the phenomenal vistas over Lake Washington, guests can enjoy a pleasant picnic on its viewing terrace, or wander along its nature trails. A play area, canoes and kayaks are also available.\n\n## 5. Bellevue Arts Museum\n\n[Image 15: Bellevue Arts Museum][Image 16: Bellevue Arts Museum]\n\nJust a short walk from both the park and bay is yet another of the city\u2019s top tourist attractions: the outstanding Bellevue Arts Museum. Packed with interesting artworks and exhibits, it lies just across the street from the massive Bellevue Square shopping center.\n\nUnlike almost all art museums, it doesn\u2019t have a permanent collection. All its unique works and thought-provoking exhibitions are temporary in nature. While it is particularly known for its amazing installations by Pacific Northwest artists, the museum is also noted for the extensive number of hands-on classes and workshops it puts on for the community each year.\n\nFounded in 1975, it occupies a striking modern building with its rotating exhibits focussing on everything from fine arts and visual design to cartoons, contemporary crafts and ceramic sculptures.\n\n## 4. Bellevue Square\n\n[Image 17: Bellevue Square][Image 18: Bellevue Square]\n\nThe best place to shop, dine and go out in the city is undoubtedly the ever-popular Bellevue Square, located right next to both the art museum and Downtown Park. With cosmetics and accessories, high fashion clothes, jewellery and luxury items, its endless array of stores certainly have you covered.\n\nSince first opening in 1946, it has expanded enormously and now impressively has over 200 shops and boutiques for visitors to peruse, with both Macy\u2019s and Nordstrum anchoring the mall. Here countless cafes and restaurants serve up delicious dishes from all around the world, with outdoor and open-air dining both being on offer.\n\nBesides shopping \u2018til you drop and sampling tasty treats, you can also go bowling, stop by its state-of-the-art cinema or enjoy some splendid live music at one of its numerous bars and clubs.\n\n## 3. Mercer Slough Nature Park\n\n[Image 19: Mercer Slough Nature Park][Image 20: Mercer Slough Nature Park]\n\nAnother picturesque spot where you can immerse yourself in nature is the lovely, lush Mercer Slough Nature Park. One of the largest parks in the city, it sprawls across a huge site with wonderful wetlands and woods to be found alongside charming creeks, open meadows and agricultural areas.\n\n", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "mclick", "args": ["[0, 2, 4, 3, 8]"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "cc90bfd4-3cbc-45a7-8d64-345dd6d53c28", "request_id": "8d39f6ae6c6fc998-IAD", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "cc90bfd4-3cbc-45a7-8d64-345dd6d53c28", "children": ["df6fc808-8422-4667-8da9-281bb09e84be"]}, "df6fc808-8422-4667-8da9-281bb09e84be": {"id": "df6fc808-8422-4667-8da9-281bb09e84be", "message": {"id": "df6fc808-8422-4667-8da9-281bb09e84be", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729101810.763644, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Here is the output for rows 101\u2013200 in CSV format:\n\n```\n&quot;Location&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;\n&quot;Bellevue, Washington&quot;,&quot;Urban Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Williams, Arizona&quot;,&quot;Natural Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Las Vegas, Nevada&quot;,&quot;Entertainment and Casinos&quot;\n&quot;Valley of Fire, Nevada&quot;,&quot;Natural Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Niagara Falls, New York&quot;,&quot;Natural Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Wharton, New Jersey&quot;,&quot;Residential&quot;\n&quot;San Francisco, California&quot;,&quot;Urban Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Broadway, New York&quot;,&quot;Theater and Entertainment&quot;\n&quot;Auburn, Washington&quot;,&quot;Natural Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Seattle, Washington&quot;,&quot;Urban Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Portland, Oregon&quot;,&quot;Urban Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Beverly Hills, California&quot;,&quot;Luxury and Shopping&quot;\n&quot;California City, California&quot;,&quot;Residential&quot;\n&quot;Orlando, Florida&quot;,&quot;Theme Parks&quot;\n&quot;Santa Monica, California&quot;,&quot;Beaches and Recreation&quot;\n&quot;Los Angeles, California&quot;,&quot;Urban Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Sausalito, California&quot;,&quot;Natural Attractions&quot;\n&quot;Menlo Park, California&quot;,&quot;Technology Hub&quot;\n&quot;Ocean City, New Jersey&quot;,&quot;Beaches and Recreation&quot;\n&quot;Hackberry, Arizona&quot;,&quot;Natural Attractions&quot;\n```\n\nThis batch covers rows 101\u2013120 with generalized categories.

However, there are some workarounds that can give you similar functionality:\n\n### Workarounds:\n\n#### 1. **Sort by a Dynamic Field (CASE Statement)**\n   You can create a new field that changes dynamically based on the value selected in a control. This approach uses a calculated field to dynamically assign numeric values that can be used for sorting:\n\n   1. **Add a Control**: Use a dropdown or single-select control that allows users to pick from various dimensions.\n   \n   2. **Create a Calculated Field**: Use a `CASE` statement to assign a numerical value based on the selected dimension.\n   \n      For example:\n      ```sql\n      CASE \n        WHEN DimensionControl = &#x27;Region&#x27; THEN Region\n        WHEN DimensionControl = &#x27;Category&#x27; THEN Category\n        ...\n      END\n      ```\n      \n   3. **Use the Calculated Field for Sorting**: Use the newly created field to sort your chart by this calculated value, allowing you to achieve the desired sorting logic.\n\n#### 2. **Create Multiple Charts and Use Visibility Controls**\n   Another approach is to create multiple charts, each sorted differently, and use a control to determine which chart is visible:\n\n   1. **Create Charts for Each Sorting Option**: Create individual charts, each sorted by a different dimension or metric.\n\n   2. **Use a Control for Selection**: Add a control (like a dropdown or a toggle) and set the **chart visibility** to show or hide different charts based on the selected value.\n\n   This method gives the appearance of dynamically changing the sort order based on the selected dimension, though it requires creating multiple charts.\n\n#### 3. **Data Transformation with Custom Fields or Blending**\n   If the data allows, you could also pre-transform your data source or use **Data Blending** to create a new data source that includes a derived column that you use to sort by based on the selection in the control. This approach would require preparing your data in a way that includes all potential sorting values in a consistent format.\n\n#### Limitations:\n- These workarounds require some pre-planning and can increase the complexity of maintaining the report.\n- The dynamic approach still lacks the flexibility of a built-in feature to dynamically change the sort directly from the control without requiring calculated fields.\n\nIf these workarounds seem complex, it might help to understand your specific use case better.

Instead, you need to handle this through the fields and data transformations available within Looker Studio&#x27;s interface. Here&#x27;s how to implement a solution similar to what you&#x27;re aiming for:\n\n### Method to Implement Sort Based on Dimension Selection:\n\n1. **Create a Control for Dimension Selection:**\n   - Add a **dropdown control** that allows users to select from a set of dimension values. For example, you could add a dropdown to select between different dimensions like &quot;Region,&quot; &quot;Category,&quot; or &quot;Product.&quot;\n\n2. **Create the Calculated Field Dynamically:**\n   - Unfortunately, Looker Studio doesn&#x27;t allow you to directly use the value from the control to create a calculated field dynamically.\n   - Instead, you need to create **multiple calculated fields**, each based on the specific dimensions you&#x27;re interested in.\n\n3. **Use CASE Statement in the Calculated Field:**\n   - Create a calculated field using the following **CASE statement** logic to create a dynamic sorting field.\n\n   For example, let\u2019s assume you have a dimension control where the user can select between &quot;Region,&quot; &quot;Category,&quot; or &quot;Product.&quot; Create a calculated field called `DynamicSort` like this:\n\n   ```sql\n   CASE\n     WHEN &quot;Your Dimension Control Field&quot; = &#x27;Region&#x27; THEN Region\n     WHEN &quot;Your Dimension Control Field&quot; = &#x27;Category&#x27; THEN Category\n     WHEN &quot;Your Dimension Control Field&quot; = &#x27;Product&#x27; THEN Product\n     ELSE NULL\n   END\n   ```\n   Here&#x27;s what you need to adjust:\n   - `&quot;Your Dimension Control Field&quot;` should be the name of the field that stores the value from the control (in practice, this is often the label of the control).\n   - `Region`, `Category`, `Product` should be the names of the fields in your dataset that correspond to the dimensions the user can select.\n\n4. **Use the `DynamicSort` Field for Sorting in Charts:**\n   - Once you have the `DynamicSort` field, you can use it in the chart configuration.\n   - Go to the chart\u2019s **Data Panel** and find the **Sort** section.\n   - Select `DynamicSort` as the field to sort by.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- **Dimension Controls as Variables:** Unfortunately, Looker Studio does not support using controls as direct references in calculations like variables in a programming environment. The workaround is to use a field with conditional logic to change behavior based on control inputs.\n- **Manual Updates:** Since Looker Studio&#x27;s calculated fields don&#x27;t reference control values directly, any new dimension needs to be manually added to both the dropdown control options and the `CASE` statement.\n\n### Example Use-Case Setup:\n- Suppose you have data with fields for &quot;Region,&quot; &quot;Category,&quot; and &quot;Product.&quot;\n- You add a **dropdown control** called &quot;Select Dimension to Sort By.&quot;\n- You create a calculated field `DynamicSort` with the `CASE` statement above to dynamically assign values based on the selected dimension.\n- You use `DynamicSort` as the **sort order** in your chart.\n\nThis approach gives you a dynamic way to change sort order based on user selection, though it requires some manual setup.

This should open the control settings panel on the right side of the screen.\n\n2. **Look for Properties in the Settings Panel**:\n   - When a **dimension control** like a dropdown or a list box is selected, there are typically two main tabs on the settings panel on the right:\n     - **Data**: Where you configure which dimensions and fields are used.\n     - **Style**: Where you adjust the look, including things like borders, text alignment, colors, etc.\n  \n   If there is no **Label** field to edit in these tabs, it\u2019s possible that this option is named differently or not explicitly present.\n\n3. **Possible Location for Label Changes**:\n   - Sometimes, the **Label** might be found under a field called **Title and Labels** within the **Style** tab.\n   - Check if you have options like **Show Title** or **Title Text**, which you can edit directly.\n   - Look specifically for the **Control Label** or **Title** option. This is where you should be able to change the name that is displayed above the dimension control.\n\n4. **Workaround**:\n   - If none of these options are available or you are unable to locate them, you can use **Text Boxes**:\n     - Add a text box near the dimension control with the desired label.\n     - This gives you flexibility to style it any way you want, though it\u2019s a manual workaround.\n\n5. **Changing Field Names**:\n   - You could also rename the **field** itself in the **Data** tab when selecting a dimension or in the **Data Source** configuration. This would apply to all uses of that dimension, including charts and controls.\n\nIf you still don\u2019t see these options, it\u2019s possible that there may have been changes in the Looker Studio interface.

You can do this by using a **fixed aggregation** or by calculating the row count and applying logic to get the maximum count across months.\n\nHowever, Looker Studio doesn\u2019t directly allow fixed aggregation across an entire dataset for a calculated field, like you would do with a window function in SQL. But there is a workaround if you want to show the maximum row count as a summary or a constant across visuals:\n\n### Step-by-Step:\n\n1. **Create a Row Count Field**:\n   - First, add a calculated field to count the rows. You can do this with a constant value of `1`, which will help in counting rows for each month.\n   ```sql\n   Row_Count := 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Chart or Table for Row Count per Month**:\n   - You can create a chart that uses &quot;Month&quot; as the dimension and sum up `Row_Count` as the metric to see how many rows you have per month.\n\n3. **Create a Calculated Field for Maximum Row Count**:\n   - Since Looker Studio doesn\u2019t allow direct reference to all rows in a calculated field, you need to use a summary function or aggregation. Here\u2019s a workaround that allows you to visually obtain this value:\n   \n   - Add a new **Scorecard** or **Summary Card** and set the aggregation to **MAX** on the `Row_Count` metric that you grouped by &quot;Month.&quot;\n\n   Here&#x27;s a Looker Studio code-like representation:\n\n   ```sql\n   MAX(SUM(Row_Count) BY Month)\n   ```\n\n   - Essentially, create a metric that sums up the rows for each month and use a `MAX` aggregation on that metric. Note that in Looker Studio, this is achieved by dragging and dropping the metrics and setting aggregation appropriately, rather than using SQL-like syntax.\n\n### Example Approach:\n\nHere is a breakdown of the steps with Looker Studio components:\n\n1. **Create the `Row_Count` Field**:\n   - Create a calculated field `Row_Count` with the value `1` to count each row:\n   ```sql\n   Row_Count := 1\n   ```\n   - Alternatively, if you have a metric already that can represent the count, you could use that.\n\n2. **Aggregate Row Count by Month**:\n   - Create a chart, such as a bar chart, with &quot;Month&quot; as a dimension and `SUM(Row_Count)` as the metric to get the count per month.\n\n3. **Use MAX to Find the Maximum Value Across All Months**:\n   - Create a **Scorecard** visual.\n   - Set the metric to `Row_Count` and the aggregation to **MAX** to get the maximum count for a month across all months.\n\n### Direct Calculated Field Limitation\n\nIn Looker Studio, due to the limitations of calculated fields (they typically cannot reference all rows across a dataset directly), the approach usually relies on summary visuals like Scorecards or aggregations that you set in the UI, rather than achieving it purely through a custom calculated field alone.\n\nUsing visuals like **Scorecards** helps you achieve this effectively by showing aggregated values like maximum or total."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug":

In Looker Studio, when calculated fields and default aggregation are limited, an alternative solution can be to pre-process the data or use blending.\n\nHere\u2019s an approach you can take:\n\n### Step 1: Pre-aggregate Data Using Blending (Blending Method)\nTo achieve the desired output in Looker Studio, you can create a new data source that pre-aggregates the maximum values for each category. Here&#x27;s how you can do this using a data blend:\n\n1. **Create a Blend of Your Data Source**:\n   - Go to **Resource &gt; Manage Blended Data** in Looker Studio.\n   - Create a new blended data source.\n   - Add your original data source twice (so you have it listed twice).\n   \n2. **Join Configuration**:\n   - Configure the join as a **left join** or **full outer join**.\n   - Set **Category** as the common dimension between the two data sources.\n   \n3. **Aggregated Fields**:\n   - For the first data source, choose **Category** and the **Month** as dimensions.\n   - For the second data source, aggregate the **Row Count** by using the `MAX(Row Count)` as a new metric, named something like `Max Count by Category`.\n\n4. **Use in Chart**:\n   - Now, you can use the blended data source for your grouped bar chart.\n   - Plot **Month** on the x-axis and use the new metric `Max Count by Category` as a value.\n   - This should show the maximum count across all months for each category, grouped appropriately.\n\n### Step 2: Pre-Process Data Outside of Looker Studio (Pre-Aggregation Method)\nAnother way would be to pre-process the data in a tool like Python (with Pandas) or Excel, to calculate the maximum count for each category, and then bring that pre-aggregated data back into Looker Studio.\n\nHere&#x27;s an example using Python:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assume your data is in a DataFrame named df with columns: &#x27;Month&#x27;, &#x27;Category&#x27;, &#x27;Count&#x27;\nmax_counts = df.groupby(&#x27;Category&#x27;)[&#x27;Count&#x27;].max().reset_index()\n\n# Save the aggregated data to a CSV file\nmax_counts.to_csv(&#x27;max_counts_per_category.csv&#x27;, index=False)\n```\n\nAfter processing, upload the new CSV file into Looker Studio and use it as your data source for the chart.\n\nThis method will allow you to calculate the maximum for each category beforehand and use it effectively in Looker Studio without facing the limitations of the platform&#x27;s calculated fields."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "parent_id": "aaa2a6a1-de9e-467b-98f0-d6e8101c252a", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8d41d85fdd5505c1-IAD", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2a6a1-de9e-467b-98f0-d6e8101c252a", "children": ["aaa2e834-9560-4100-a0a4-421ec02ba97f"]}, "aaa2e834-9560-4100-a0a4-421ec02ba97f": {"id": "aaa2e834-9560-4100-a0a4-421ec02ba97f", "message": {"id": "aaa2e834-9560-4100-a0a4-421ec02ba97f", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729190307.773883, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["hm not working, can&#x27;t do a max as aggregate"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8d4267dbe8867fb2-IAD", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5b9d6091-6f56-466a-a043-7f8faf7cd64d", "children": ["bb87f5e9-a705-47ce-930b-0ad4969b4ff3"]}, "bb87f5e9-a705-47ce-930b-0ad4969b4ff3": {"id": "bb87f5e9-a705-47ce-930b-0ad4969b4ff3", "message": {"id": "bb87f5e9-a705-47ce-930b-0ad4969b4ff3", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729190321.293019, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It looks like the blending approach is restricted in this case. Here&#x27;s another method to dynamically find the max per category for a grouped bar chart:\n\n### Using a Calculated Field to Display the Maximum Value Dynamically\nIf you want the chart to reflect the maximum row count across all months, but within each specific category, and it should be dynamic, you can use a calculated field with a workaround to simulate this behavior. Unfortunately, Looker Studio&#x27;s calculated fields have limitations when working directly with aggregate functions like `MAX()` over a grouped field.\n\nHere&#x27;s an alternative:\n\n1. **Create a Reference Table:**\n   First, create a reference table in a separate tool (like Excel or Python) to pre-calculate the max count per category.\n\n   - For example, use Python to do this:\n\n     ```python\n     import pandas as pd\n\n     # Assuming your data is in a DataFrame called df with columns: &#x27;Category&#x27;, &#x27;Month&#x27;, &#x27;Count&#x27;\n     max_counts = df.groupby(&#x27;Category&#x27;)[&#x27;Count&#x27;].max().reset_index()\n     max_counts.columns = [&#x27;Category&#x27;, &#x27;Max Count&#x27;]\n     \n     # Save this reference table to a CSV\n     max_counts.to_csv(&#x27;max_counts.csv&#x27;, index=False)\n     ```\n\n   - Now, upload this CSV (`max_counts.csv`) into Looker Studio as a new data source.\n\n2. **Join the Reference Table:**\n   Create a data blend in Looker Studio:\n\n   - Blend your original data source with the newly uploaded reference data source (`max_counts.csv`).\n   - Set `Category` as the join key for both data sources.\n\n3. **Add the Blended Field:**\n   Once the blending is done:\n   - You should have a field from the reference table that contains the maximum count for each category.\n   - You can use this `Max Count` field from the reference table in your grouped bar chart.\n\n4. **Chart Configuration:**\n   - For your bar chart, use:\n     - **Dimension**: `Month` and `Category`.\n     - **Metrics**: `Count` (to display the actual count for each month-category) and `Max Count` (blended from the reference table) to show the maximum across all months for that category.\n   - This way, your chart will include bars for the count per month and can also show a consistent reference line or bar representing the maximum count for the whole category.\n\n### Limitations and Notes:\n- Looker Studio doesn\u2019t support complex aggregation calculations that involve comparing across different groups directly within calculated fields. This workaround allows you to pre-compute the value outside Looker Studio and then use it in visualizations.\n- The blending feature is powerful for these use cases but can sometimes be tricky when combining multiple data sources. Make sure to test the join conditions thoroughly.\n\nIf this approach still has limitations based on your dataset size or complexity, I can help you explore further options or tweaks!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "parent_id": "aaa2e834-9560-4100-a0a4-421ec02ba97f", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8d4267dbe8867fb2-IAD", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2e834-9560-4100-a0a4-421ec02ba97f", "children": ["aaa25002-dbff-4f8d-afe9-a8c67b1b3db1"]}, "aaa25002-dbff-4f8d-afe9-a8c67b1b3db1": {"id": "aaa25002-dbff-4f8d-afe9-a8c67b1b3db1", "message": {"id": "aaa25002-dbff-4f8d-afe9-a8c67b1b3db1", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729190332.086063, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["can you export the chat from the past week as a text file?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8d426874ea5e7fb2-IAD", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "bb87f5e9-a705-47ce-930b-0ad4969b4ff3", "children": ["f77e25a7-e498-43ee-914e-6511f58b8f02"]}, "f77e25a7-e498-43ee-914e-6511f58b8f02": {"id": "f77e25a7-e498-43ee-914e-6511f58b8f02", "message": {"id": "f77e25a7-e498-43ee-914e-6511f58b8f02", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729190337.922864, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I currently don&#x27;t have the ability to directly export our conversation history as a text file.

However, here are a few strategies to achieve your goal:\n\n### 1. Use Blending\n- **Data Blending**: One approach is to use a *data blend* to combine the main dataset with an aggregated version of the same dataset. Here&#x27;s how you could do it:\n  1. **Create an Aggregated Data Source**: Create a new data source where you group by your dimension (e.g., category) and calculate the maximum count for each category.\n  2. **Blend the Data Sources**: Blend this aggregated data source with your main data source using a common key (e.g., category).\n  3. **Use the Blended Field**: The blended data will now have the original values along with the maximum count for that group, which you can use for visualization.\n\n### 2. Window Functions in the Original Data Source\n- If you have control over the original dataset (e.g., in BigQuery or another database), you could add a window function to calculate the maximum count per group. For example:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT \n    *,\n    MAX(count) OVER (PARTITION BY category) AS max_category_count\n  FROM your_table\n  ```\n  Then use this calculated field in Looker Studio for easy visualization.\n\n### 3. Creating a Comparison Metric\n- If you want to create a visual that shows the maximum count per group alongside other metrics in Looker Studio:\n  1. **Create a Calculated Field**: Create a field like `IsMaxCount` that returns 1 if a row is the maximum for that category. You could use something like:\n     ```plaintext\n     COUNT(FieldName) = MAX(COUNT(FieldName))\n     ```\n     Unfortunately, this approach might be too complex or unsupported due to aggregation levels in Looker Studio. So you might have to split this logic at the data preparation level.\n\n### 4. Use Custom SQL Query\n- If Looker Studio allows you to use a custom SQL query on your data source, you can achieve the required grouping and calculation using SQL.\n  - Use a SQL query to pre-aggregate the data before loading it into Looker Studio.\n  - Example:\n    ```sql\n    SELECT \n      category,\n      MAX(count) AS max_count\n    FROM your_table\n    GROUP BY category\n    ```\n\nLet me know if you&#x27;d like more details on any of these methods or if you have more constraints regarding the data sources you are using!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "parent_id": "aaa213ad-e879-4566-859d-1c6e9642b74a", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8d42831e190b8847-IAD", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa213ad-e879-4566-859d-1c6e9642b74a", "children": ["aaa270a5-00dd-456c-9a0e-a0b3586f9db3"]}, "aaa270a5-00dd-456c-9a0e-a0b3586f9db3": {"id": "aaa270a5-00dd-456c-9a0e-a0b3586f9db3", "message": {"id": "aaa270a5-00dd-456c-9a0e-a0b3586f9db3", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729191803.581249, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["how about in python"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8d428c604ba08847-IAD", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ef823c55-0e8f-4bfe-bc34-bdee1047729f", "children": ["a9fb8a0d-666e-4b4c-8477-551483d1fee7"]}, "a9fb8a0d-666e-4b4c-8477-551483d1fee7": {"id": "a9fb8a0d-666e-4b4c-8477-551483d1fee7", "message": {"id": "a9fb8a0d-666e-4b4c-8477-551483d1fee7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729191817.469061, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["If you want to calculate the maximum count per group (e.g., month and category) using Python, you can achieve it quite effectively with the help of the `pandas` library. Here is an example that illustrates this process:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach Using Python and Pandas:\n\n1. **Import Pandas and Load Data**: First, import the pandas library and load your data.\n2. **Group the Data**: Group by `month` and `category` to calculate the counts.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Count per Category**: Use aggregation to calculate the maximum counts for each category.\n\nHere&#x27;s how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndata = {\n    &#x27;month&#x27;: [&#x27;January&#x27;, &#x27;January&#x27;, &#x27;February&#x27;, &#x27;February&#x27;, &#x27;March&#x27;, &#x27;March&#x27;, &#x27;March&#x27;],\n    &#x27;category&#x27;: [&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;A&#x27;],\n    &#x27;value&#x27;: [10, 20, 15, 25, 30, 35, 40]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Step 1: Group by month and category, and count occurrences\ncount_df = df.groupby([&#x27;month&#x27;, &#x27;category&#x27;]).size().reset_index(name=&#x27;count&#x27;)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the maximum count for each category across all months\nmax_count_per_category = count_df.groupby(&#x27;category&#x27;)[&#x27;count&#x27;].max().reset_index(name=&#x27;max_count&#x27;)\n\n# Merge the max count back to the original grouped data\nmerged_df = pd.merge(count_df, max_count_per_category, on=&#x27;category&#x27;)\n\n# Display the final DataFrame\nprint(merged_df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Group by Month and Category**:\n   ```python\n   count_df = df.groupby([&#x27;month&#x27;, &#x27;category&#x27;]).size().reset_index(name=&#x27;count&#x27;)\n   ```\n   This groups the data by `month` and `category`, and calculates the count of rows in each group.\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum Count for Each Category**:\n   ```python\n   max_count_per_category = count_df.groupby(&#x27;category&#x27;)[&#x27;count&#x27;].max().reset_index(name=&#x27;max_count&#x27;)\n   ```\n   This groups the data by `category` and calculates the maximum value of `count` for each category.\n\n3. **Merge the Results**:\n   ```python\n   merged_df = pd.merge(count_df, max_count_per_category, on=&#x27;category&#x27;)\n   ```\n   This merges the maximum count information back with the original grouped data to provide a comparison.\n\n### Result:\n\nThe `merged_df` DataFrame will contain the `month`, `category`, the `count` for each (month, category) combination, and the `max_count` for each `category` across all months. This allows you to easily compare each month&#x27;s count with the maximum for that category.\n\n### Plotting the Data:\n\nIf you want to create a grouped bar chart to visualize the counts and maximum values, you can use `matplotlib` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Plotting\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Plot the counts per month and category\nfor key, grp in count_df.groupby([&#x27;category&#x27;]):\n    ax = grp.plot(ax=ax, kind=&#x27;bar&#x27;, x=&#x27;month&#x27;, y=&#x27;count&#x27;, label=key)\n\nplt.xlabel(&#x27;Month&#x27;)\nplt.ylabel(&#x27;Count&#x27;)\nplt.title(&#x27;Count per Month and Category&#x27;)\nplt.legend(title=&#x27;Category&#x27;)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis should give you a bar chart that visualizes the counts for each category per month. If you&#x27;d like to highlight the maximum value per category, you can overlay horizontal lines using the `max_count` values."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "parent_id": "aaa270a5-00dd-456c-9a0e-a0b3586f9db3", "request_id": "8d428c604ba08847-IAD", "timestamp_": "absolute", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa270a5-00dd-456c-9a0e-a0b3586f9db3", "children": ["aaa2a993-004a-4e4b-a905-2c4c79228fd1"]}, "aaa2a993-004a-4e4b-a905-2c4c79228fd1": {"id": "aaa2a993-004a-4e4b-a905-2c4c79228fd1", "message": {"id": "aaa2a993-004a-4e4b-a905-2c4c79228fd1", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729197715.422146, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["can you do images"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8d431cb5a89f5776-IAD", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a9fb8a0d-666e-4b4c-8477-551483d1fee7", "children": ["dd55d476-5568-456e-80a1-32c2ceac7374"]}, "dd55d476-5568-456e-80a1-32c2ceac7374": {"id": "dd55d476-5568-456e-80a1-32c2ceac7374", "message": {"id": "dd55d476-5568-456e-80a1-32c2ceac7374", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729197721.973893, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, I can generate images based on text descriptions!

The film, directed by Rob Reiner and written by Nora Ephron, delves into themes of friendship, love, and the question of whether men and women can truly be friends without romantic feelings interfering.\n\n### 1977: The Beginning\nHarry and Sally meet for the first time in 1977 when they share a car ride from the University of Chicago to New York City after graduating. During the trip, they engage in a spirited debate about whether men and women can be just friends. Harry insists, &quot;Men and women can&#x27;t be friends because the sex part always gets in the way.&quot; Sally disagrees, believing in the possibility of platonic relationships. Their differing viewpoints and clashing personalities make the journey tense, and they part ways upon arriving in New York, seemingly never to see each other again.\n\n### Five Years Later\nIn 1982, Harry and Sally unexpectedly meet again on a flight. Harry is now engaged, while Sally is dating someone else. Despite recognizing each other, their interaction is brief and somewhat awkward. They part ways once more, still skeptical about each other&#x27;s beliefs and lifestyles.\n\n### Another Five Years Later\nIn 1987, Harry and Sally meet again in a New York bookstore. Both are now single, having experienced recent heartbreaks\u2014Harry is getting a divorce, and Sally&#x27;s long-term relationship has ended. This time, they decide to become friends and begin spending more time together, supporting each other through their respective breakups. They develop a close friendship, sharing deep conversations and moments of laughter. Sally introduces Harry to her friends Marie (Carrie Fisher) and Jess (Bruno Kirby), and the four often spend time together.\n\n### Friendship and Growing Feelings\nAs Harry and Sally&#x27;s friendship deepens, they help each other navigate the challenges of single life in New York City. They share memorable moments, such as the iconic scene in Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen, where Sally fakes an orgasm to prove a point about women&#x27;s ability to deceive men. An amused onlooker famously remarks, &quot;I&#x27;ll have what she&#x27;s having.&quot;\n\nDespite their closeness, both Harry and Sally are hesitant to acknowledge their growing romantic feelings for each other. They try dating other people but find themselves drawn back to each other. Their friendship is tested when Harry confesses that he finds Sally attractive, which complicates their dynamic.\n\n### The Turning Point\nDuring a New Year&#x27;s Eve party, Harry and Sally confront their feelings. Harry realizes he is in love with Sally, but she is hurt and confused by his previous reluctance to commit. They have a falling out, and Sally decides to distance herself from Harry, believing their friendship is over.\n\n### The Climax\nOn New Year&#x27;s Eve, Harry, reflecting on his feelings and their history, rushes to find Sally at a party. He delivers an emotional speech, declaring, &quot;When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.&quot; Sally is moved by his sincerity, and they share a heartfelt kiss, acknowledging that they belong together.\n\n### Epilogue\nThe film concludes with Harry and Sally married, discussing their relationship in an interview format that is interspersed throughout the movie. They reflect on their journey, reaffirming the idea that true love often starts with friendship. Their story underscores the film&#x27;s central message: love can be complicated, but it&#x27;s worth pursuing when it&#x27;s with the right person.\n\n**Quotes:**\n1. &quot;Men and women can&#x27;t be friends because the sex part always gets in the way.&quot; - Harry\n2. &quot;I&#x27;ll have what she&#x27;s having.&quot; - Onlooker in Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen\n3. &quot;When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.&quot; - Harry"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "aaa2a90c-bc9c-43c1-9dfa-13f7c31ff238", "request_id": "8943df2a483f82b6-IAD", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2a90c-bc9c-43c1-9dfa-13f7c31ff238", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "217ed5dc-b4e3-457b-bb4d-b35779def6dc", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "9ce624e5-7a48-45c8-9525-1b9296c171c8", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "auto", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "9ce624e5-7a48-45c8-9525-1b9296c171c8"}, {"title": "Notting Hill Love Story", "create_time": 1718201094.820431, "update_time": 1718287311.438292, "mapping": {"fa9426cb-f3fc-45d2-8cda-2307fae525b7": {"id": "fa9426cb-f3fc-45d2-8cda-2307fae525b7", "message": {"id": "fa9426cb-f3fc-45d2-8cda-2307fae525b7", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa10b05-80b9-41a0-9f28-4839d366d662", "children": ["aaa2c482-1ab6-4be8-8f97-6c173b5deba5"]}, "aaa10b05-80b9-41a0-9f28-4839d366d662": {"id": "aaa10b05-80b9-41a0-9f28-4839d366d662", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["fa9426cb-f3fc-45d2-8cda-2307fae525b7"]}, "aaa2c482-1ab6-4be8-8f97-6c173b5deba5": {"id": "aaa2c482-1ab6-4be8-8f97-6c173b5deba5", "message": {"id": "aaa2c482-1ab6-4be8-8f97-6c173b5deba5", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1718201094.822283, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["can you write a plot summary of notting hill with specific plot details, using the meter and rhyme scheme of i want it that way"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "892a648879b62d1f-IAD", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "fa9426cb-f3fc-45d2-8cda-2307fae525b7", "children": ["091bad00-9783-4ae9-960e-fa65e0fc2461"]}, "091bad00-9783-4ae9-960e-fa65e0fc2461": {"id": "091bad00-9783-4ae9-960e-fa65e0fc2461", "message": {"id": "091bad00-9783-4ae9-960e-fa65e0fc2461", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1718201110.69474, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure!

Here are a few more math-related activities for your four-year-old:\n\n1. Shape Hunt: Go on a shape scavenger hunt around your home or a nearby park. Encourage your child to find and identify different shapes, such as circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles in their environment.\n\n2. Counting Game: Turn everyday activities into counting opportunities. Count how many steps you take to reach a specific location, how many toys are in a box, or how many apples you have in the kitchen.\n\n3. Measurement Fun: Teach basic measurement concepts by comparing the lengths of different objects using non-standard units like paperclips or LEGO bricks. Have your child determine which object is longer or shorter.\n\n4. Math Storytime: Find children&#x27;s books that incorporate math concepts, such as counting, addition, or shapes. Reading math-themed stories can make learning more enjoyable.\n\n5. Math Art: Combine art and math by creating geometric shape artwork. Your child can use various shapes to make a unique masterpiece.\n\n6. Cooking Together: Involve your child in the kitchen and let them measure ingredients, count how many items are needed for a recipe, and discuss fractions when cutting or dividing portions.\n\n7. Number Bingo: Create a simple bingo game with numbers. You can make bingo cards with numbers and use small objects like buttons as markers. It&#x27;s a fun way to reinforce number recognition.\n\nRemember to keep the activities age-appropriate and fun, and adapt them to your child&#x27;s interests and learning style.

Creating a tooltip or a hover effect in PowerPoint isn&#x27;t a built-in feature like it is on webpages, but you can simulate a similar effect using hyperlinks and action settings. Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide on how to create a tooltip when hovering over text in a PowerPoint presentation:\n\n1. **Open your PowerPoint Presentation**: Launch PowerPoint and open the presentation in which you want to create the tooltip effect.\n\n2. **Insert a Text Box**: Click on the slide where you want to add the tooltip. Go to the &quot;Insert&quot; tab, click on &quot;Text Box,&quot; and then click on the slide to insert a text box.\n\n3. **Add the Text**: Type the text that you want to display as the tooltip inside the text box. This text will be what appears when you hover over the trigger text.\n\n4. **Format the Tooltip Text**: You can format the tooltip text to make it stand out. Change the font, size, color, or apply other formatting options as needed.\n\n5. **Position the Tooltip Text**: Move the text box to where you want the tooltip to appear when you hover over a specific area of your slide. Make sure it doesn&#x27;t overlap with other important content.\n\n6. **Insert a Trigger Text**: Add the text that you want to act as the trigger for the tooltip. This is the text that the user will hover over to reveal the tooltip. You can use a separate text box for this or use existing text on the slide.\n\n7. **Create a Hyperlink for the Trigger Text**: Select the trigger text, then go to the &quot;Insert&quot; tab and click &quot;Hyperlink&quot; (or right-click and choose &quot;Hyperlink&quot;). In the &quot;Insert Hyperlink&quot; dialog box, select &quot;Place in This Document&quot; on the left and then choose the slide that you&#x27;re currently on. Click &quot;OK&quot; to create the hyperlink.\n\n8. **Set the Action Settings**: After creating the hyperlink, you can set up the action settings. Right-click on the trigger text, and choose &quot;Action Settings&quot; from the context menu.\n\n9. **Configure Mouse Over (Hover) Action**: In the &quot;Action Settings&quot; dialog box, under the &quot;Mouse Over&quot; tab, select &quot;Hyperlink to&quot; and choose the slide that contains your tooltip text. Click &quot;OK&quot; to confirm.\n\n10. **Test the Tooltip**: Play the presentation and hover your mouse over the trigger text. You should see the tooltip text appear.\n\n11. **Adjust Timing and Appearance**: You can further refine the appearance and timing of the tooltip by adjusting animations, transitions, and the duration of the slide containing the tooltip.\n\n12. **Repeat for Additional Tooltips**: If you want to create more tooltips, repeat the process for each one.\n\nRemember that this method doesn&#x27;t exactly replicate a traditional web-based tooltip, but it provides a way to create a similar effect within a PowerPoint presentation by using hyperlinks and action settings."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "parent_id": "aaa25d66-6d6b-48cd-aefd-c8eaa4e27eb6", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa25d66-6d6b-48cd-aefd-c8eaa4e27eb6", "children": ["aaa29cc5-f67e-4558-8893-3afb8698a290"]}, "aaa29cc5-f67e-4558-8893-3afb8698a290": {"id": "aaa29cc5-f67e-4558-8893-3afb8698a290", "message": {"id": "aaa29cc5-f67e-4558-8893-3afb8698a290", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1695405004.334413, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["i can&#x27;t see the action setttings in step 8"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "220cff21-af99-4617-a27b-831c1dd98657", "children": ["6896ea5e-cf32-4b2c-8c68-0a31c152f21f"]}, "6896ea5e-cf32-4b2c-8c68-0a31c152f21f": {"id": "6896ea5e-cf32-4b2c-8c68-0a31c152f21f", "message": {"id": "6896ea5e-cf32-4b2c-8c68-0a31c152f21f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1695405015.251487, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I apologize for any confusion. The availability of action settings might depend on the version of PowerPoint you are using. If you can&#x27;t see the action settings in the way described in step 8, you might be using a version of PowerPoint that does not have this feature.\n\nHere&#x27;s an alternative approach to create a tooltip-like effect in PowerPoint that doesn&#x27;t rely on action settings:\n\n1. **Insert the Tooltip Text Box**:\n   - On the slide where you want the tooltip, insert a text box (go to the &quot;Insert&quot; tab, then choose &quot;Text Box&quot;) and type your tooltip content inside it.\n   - Position this text box where you want the tooltip to appear when triggered.\n\n2. **Add Trigger Text**:\n   - Insert a separate text box or use existing text on the slide as the trigger text. This is the text that the user will hover over to reveal the tooltip.\n\n3. **Group the Trigger and Tooltip Text**:\n   - Select both the trigger text and the tooltip text box by holding the Shift key while clicking on them.\n   - Right-click on one of the selected items and choose &quot;Group&quot; or &quot;Grouping&quot; (the wording may vary depending on your PowerPoint version).\n\n4. **Create a Slide Transition**:\n   - Go to the &quot;Transitions&quot; tab.\n   - Set the transition to &quot;Fade&quot; or any other transition effect you prefer. Adjust the transition duration as needed.\n\n5. **Set Start Transition to Mouse Click**:\n   - In the &quot;Advance Slide&quot; section of the Transitions tab, change the &quot;On Mouse Click&quot; option to &quot;After&quot; and set the duration to a very short time, such as 0.01 seconds.\n\n6. **Test the Tooltip Effect**:\n   - Play the presentation.\n   - When you click the trigger text during the presentation, the tooltip text should appear as if it&#x27;s a tooltip.\n\nThis method relies on slide transitions to simulate the tooltip effect when you click the trigger text.
